# [Reactome](https://reactome.org/), Python, and Neo4j

Explore biomolecular pathways in Reactome from the command-line or a Python script.    

In addition to biomolecular pathways,
Reactome contains 
expert-authored and peer-reviewed
reactions, 
molecular complex ingredients and structure, and
protein-protein interactions.

Reactome also provides links from pathways, reactions, and molecules to 
biological models, associated research papers, URLs, and books.


## Use this Python3 library to:

  1) Run [**Reactome's Neo4j Tutorial**](https://reactome.org/dev/graph-database/extract-participating-molecules)
     from one of the [**Jupyter notebooks**](/src/ipy/tutorial/README.md)
     or a plain [**Python script**](/src/bin_neo4j/tutorial)

  2) Find enriched pathways
     [**from the command line**](/doc/md/README_analyses.md),
     accessing Reactome's online
     [**Pathway Analysis Service**](https://reactome.org/AnalysisService/) 

  3) Write your own Python scripts accessing the Reactome database through Neo4j
