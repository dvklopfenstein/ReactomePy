Explore biological pathways in Reactome using Python to query neo4j

  * [**Scripts**](#scripts)
    1. [Pathway Scripts](#pathway_scripts)     
       _You do not need to have Neo4j loaded and running on downloaded Reactome data._    
       Uses Reactome data previously extracted using Neo4j and stored in this repo.    
    2. [Reactome/Neo4j Tutorial Scripts](#neo4j_scripts)    
       Runs the Neo4j queries from a Python script from [Reactome's Tutorial](https://reactome.org/dev/graph-database/extract-participating-molecules)

## Scripts

### 1) Pathway Scripts
Pathway scripts use Reactome data saved into Python modules.    
Neo4j does not need to be running to use these scripts.    

### 2) Neo4j Scripts
Neo4j scripts require that Neo4j loaded with Reactome is working on your machine.
