    2060289: '''Autosomal dominant mutations in FGFR2 are associated with the development of a range of skeletal disorders including Beare-Stevensen cutis gyrata syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome, Jackson-Weiss syndrome, Crouzon syndrome and Apert Syndrome (reveiwed in Burke, 1998; Webster and Donoghue 1997; Cunningham, 2007).  Mutations that give rise to Crouzon, Jackson-Weiss and Pfeiffer syndromes tend to cluster in the third Ig-like domain of the receptor, either in exon IIIa (shared by the IIIb and the IIIc isoforms) or in the FGFR2c-specific exon IIIc.  These mutations frequently involve creation or removal of a cysteine residue, leading to the formation of an unpaired cysteine residue that is thought to promote intramolecular dimerization and thus constitutive, ligand-independent activation (reviewed in Burke, 1998; Webster and Donoghue, 1997; Cunningham, 2007).  Mutations in FGFR2 that give rise to Apert Syndrome cluster to the highly conserved Pro-Ser dipeptide in the IgII-Ig III linker; mutations in the paralogous residues of FGFR1 and 3 give rise to Pfeiffer and Muenke syndromes, respectively (Muenke, 1994; Wilkie, 1995; Bellus, 1996). Development of Beare-Stevensen cutis gyrata is associated with mutations in the transmembrane-proximal region of the receptor (Przylepa, 1996), and similar mutations in FGFR3 are linked to the development of thanatophoric dysplasia I (Tavormina, 1995a).  These mutations all affect FGFR2 signaling without altering the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor.<br><br><br>Activating point mutations have also been identified in FGFR2 in ~15% of endometrial cancers, as well as to a lesser extent in ovarian and gastric cancers (Dutt, 2008; Pollock, 2007; Byron, 2010; Jang, 2001).  These mutations are found largely in the extracellular region and in the kinase domain of the receptor, and parallel activating mutations seen in autosomal dominant disorders described above.<br><br><br>Activating mutations in FGFR2 are thought to contribute to receptor activation through diverse mechanisms, including constitutive ligand-independent dimerization (Robertson, 1998), expanded range and affinity for ligand (Ibrahimi, 2004b; Yu, 2000) and enhanced kinase activity (Byron, 2008; Chen, 2007).''',

    9015299: '''Interleukin-18 (IL18, pro-IL18) is a pleiotropic and pro inflammatory cytokine. It belongs to the Interleukin-1 (IL1 superfamily (Alboni et al. 2010, Krumm et al. 2017, Dinarello 1999). IL18 is synthesized as an inactive 24-kDa precursor protein that is cleaved by extracellular proteases such as caspase-1, protease 3, serine protease, elastase or cathepsin G (Fantuzzi & Dinarello 1999, Gracie et al. 2004, Sugawara et al. 2001), forming an 18-kDa mature protein (Arend et al. 2008, Akita et al. 1997, Fantuzzi et al. 1998, Ghayur et al. 1997, Gu et al. 1997, Ushio et al. 1996). <br>IL18 also occurs as a short isoform, the result of an alternative splicing event that removes 57 bp/19 aa (IL18alpha) (Conti et al. 1997, Yang et al. 2005). This short isoform has a modest synergistic action with the IL18 canonical active form.

The IL18 receptor (IL18R) belongs to the Interleukin-1 receptor/Toll like receptor superfamily. It consists of two subunits, Interleukin-18 receptor 1 (IL18R1, IL-18Rα, IL1Rrp1, IL18R1, IL-1R5) and Interleukin-18 receptor accessory protein (IL18RAP, IL18RB, IL-18Rβ,IL-18RacP, IL-18RII or IL-1R7). Both subunits have three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and one intracellular Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain (O'Neill & Dinarello 2000, Sims 2002). It is believed that IL18 binds first to IL18R1 and later recruits IL18RAP to form a high-affinity heterotrimeric complex (Sims 2002, Sergi & Pentilla 2004, Alboni et al. 2009).  A short isoform of IL18R1 lacks the TIR domain (IL18R1 type II) (Alboni et al. 2009), which is required for signaling, leading to the suggestion that IL18R1 type II is a decoy receptor (Colotta et al. 1994). A truncated form of IL18RAP containing only one of the three immunoglobulin domains stabilizes IL18 binding to IL18R1 but prevents signaling.<br>IL-18 binding protein (IL18BP), a 38-kDa soluble protein, is another negative regulator of IL18 signaling. It has some sequence homology with IL18R1 (Im et al. 2002 , Kim et al. 2002, Novick et al. 1999). IL18BP binds with high affinity to mature IL18, preventing its interaction with IL18R1. Several isoforms IL18BP have been described (Kim et al. 2000). Interleukin-37 (IL37, IL-1F7), another negative regulator of IL18 signaling, is able to bind IL18BP and IL18RAP preventing signaling (Bufler et al.2002, Pan et al. 2001, Kumar et al. 2002).<br>IL18 stimulates Interferon gamma (IFNG, IFN-γ) production from T-helper lymphocytes cells (Th1) and macrophages and enhances the cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells. IL18 stimulated IFNG production is synergistically amplified by other Th1-related cytokines such as IL2, IL15, IL12 and IL23 (Boraschi & Dinarello 2006, Park et al. 2007, Dinarello 2007, Dinarello & Fantuzzi 2003).''',
    425988: '''The SLC9 gene family encode proteins (sodium/proton exchangers, NHE or NHX) which exchange sodium (influx) for protons (efflux) electroneutrally. This mechanism is important because many metabolic processes generate acids which need to be removed to maintain pH.

    2408461: '''STING (stimulator of IFN genes; also known as MITA/ERIS/MPYS/TMEM173) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident, which is required for effective type I IFN production in response to nucleic acids. Indeed, select pathogen-derived DNA or RNA were shown to activate STING in human and mouse cells (Ishikawa H and Barber GN 2008; Ishikawa H et al. 2009; Sun W et al. 2009; Prantner D et al. 2010). Importantly, in vitro studies have shown that STING is essential for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Manzanillo PS et al. 2012), Plasmodium falciparum (Sharma S et al. 2011) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) induced type I IFN production [Yan N et al 2010]. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, plasmodium falciparum and HIV are three deadliest pathogens, which kill millions of people each year worldwide.<p>STING has been also implicated in type I IFN response which was stimulated by fusion of viral and target-cell membrane in a manner independent of DNA, RNA and viral capsid  [Holm CK et al 2012].<p>Under steady state conditions, STING is positioned at the translocon complex within the ER membrane. However upon stimulation with intracellular DNA it translocates from ER to perinuclear vesicles via the Golgi by mechanisms that remain unclear (Ishikawa H and Barber GN 2008; Sun W et al. 2009; Ishikawa H et al. 2009; Saitoh T et al. 2009). Mouse Sting trafficking in dsDNA-stimulated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) cells was found to depend on autophagy-related gene 9a (Atg9a) (Saitoh T et al. 2009).<p>STING was reported to function as a signaling adaptor or coreceptor in response to cytosolic dsDNA (Unterholzner L et al. 2010; Zhang Z et al. 2011). STING was also shown to function as a direct DNA sensor to induce the innate immune response in human telomerase fibroblasts (hTERT-BJ1) and murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Abe T et al. 2013). Additionally, STING is thought to function as a direct sensor of cyclic dinucleotides. STING was shown to interact directly with c-di-GMP in human embryonic kidney HEK293T cell lysates (Burdette DL et al. 2011). Once STING is stimulated, its C-terminus serves as a signaling scaffold to recruit IRF3 and TBK1, which leads to TBK1-dependent phosphorylation of IRF3 (Tanaka Y and Chen ZJ 2012).<p>Mouse, but not human STING, can also bind vascular disrupting agents 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) and the antiviral small molecule 10-carboxymethyl-9-acridanone (CMA) to induce type I IFN production, suggesting a species-specific drug effect on the STING-mediated host response (Conlon J et al. 2013; Cavlar T et al. 2013).''',

    2043919: '''NOTCH undergoes final posttranslational processing in the Golgi apparatus (Lardelli et al. 1994, Blaumueller et al. 1997, Weinmaster et al. 1991, Weinmaster et al. 1992, Uyttendaele et al. 1996). Movement of NOTCH precursors from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi is controlled by SEL1L protein, a homolog of C. elegans sel-1. SEL1L localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and prevents translocation of misfolded proteins, therefore serving as a quality control check (Li et al. 2010, Sundaram et al. 1993, Francisco et al. 2010). Similarly, C. elegans sel-9 and its mammalian homolog TMED2 are Golgi membrane proteins that participate in quality control of proteins transported from Golgi to the plasma membrane. Translocation of a mutant C. elegans NOTCH homolog lin-12 from the Golgi to the plasma membrane is negatively regulated by sel-9 (Wen et al. 1999). A GTPase RAB6 positively controls NOTCH trafficking through Golgi (Purcell et al. 1999). <br><br> <br>Processing of mammalian NOTCH precursors in the Golgi typically involves the cleavage by FURIN convertase. Pre-NOTCH is a ~300 kDa protein, and cleavage by FURIN produces two fragments with approximate sizes of 110 kDa and 180 kDa. The 110 kDa fragment contains the transmembrane and intracellular domains of NOTCH and is known as NTM or NTMICD. The 189 kDa fragment contains NOTCH extracellular sequence and is known as NEC or NECD. The NTM and NEC fragments heterodimerize (Blaumueller et al. 1997, Logeat et al. 1998, Chan et al. 1998) and are held together by disulfide bonds and calcium ions (Rand et al. 2000, Gordon et al. 2009). <br> <br> <br>An optional step in Pre-NOTCH processing in the Golgi is modification by fringe enzymes. Fringe enzymes are glycosyl transferases that initiate elongation of O-linked fucose on fucosylated peptides by addition of a beta 1,3 N-acetylglucosaminyl group, resulting in formation of disaccharide chains on NOTCH EGF repeats (GlcNAc-bet1,3-fucitol). Three fringe enzymes are known in mammals: LFNG (lunatic fringe), MFNG (manic fringe) and RFNG (radical fringe). LFNG shows the highest catalytic activity in modifying NOTCH (Bruckner et al. 2000, Moloney et al. 2000). Fringe-created disaccharide chains on NOTCH EGF repeats are further extended by B4GALT1 (beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1), which adds galactose to the N-acetylglucosaminyl group, resulting in formation of trisaccharide Gal-beta1,4-GlcNAc-beta1,3-fucitol chains (Moloney et al. 2000, Chen et al. 2001). Formation of trisaccharide chains is the minimum requirement for fringe-mediated modulation of NOTCH signaling, although fringe-modified NOTCH expressed on the cell surface predominantly contains tetrasaccharide chains on EGF repeats. The tetrasaccharide chains are formed by sialyltransferase(s) that add sialic acid to galactose, resulting in formation of Sia-alpha2,3-Gal-beta1,4-GlcNAc-beta1,3-fucitol (Moloney et al. 2000). Three known Golgi membrane sialyltransferases could be performing this function: ST3GAL3, ST3GAL4 and ST3GAL6 (Harduin-Lepers et al. 2001). The modification of NOTCH by fringe enzymes modulates NOTCH-signaling by increasing the affinity of NOTCH receptors for delta-like ligands, DLL1 and DLL4, while decreasing affinity for jagged ligands, JAG1 and JAG2.

    6807570: '''Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small molecular weight proteins with broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against bacteria, viruses, and fungi (Zasloff M 2002; Radek K & Gallo R 2007). The majority of known AMPs are cationic peptides with common structural characteristics where domains of hydrophobic and cationic amino acids are spatially arranged into an amphipathic design, which facilitates their interaction with bacterial membranes (Shai Y 2002; Yeaman MR & Yount NY 2003; Brown KL & Hancock RE 2006; Dennison SR et al. 2005; Zelezetsky I & Tossi A 2006). It is generally excepted that the electrostatic interaction facilitates the initial binding of the positively charged peptides to the negatively charged bacterial membrane. Moreover, the structural amphiphilicity of AMPs is thought to promote their integration into lipid bilayers of pathogenic cells, leading to membrane disintegration and finally to the microbial cell death. In addition to cationic AMPs a few anionic antimicrobial peptides have been found in humans, however their mechanism of action remains to be clarified (Lai Y et al. 2007; Harris F et al. 2009; Paulmann M et al. 2012).

    9027599: '''Electrophilic oxo-derivatives of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) are generated in macrophages and neutrophils in response to inflammation and oxidative stress to promote the resolution of inflammation. Being electrophilic, these derivatives reversibly bind to nucleophilic residues on target proteins (thiolates of cysteines and amino groups of histidine and lysine), triggering the activation of cytoprotective pathways. These include the Nrf2 antioxidant response, the heat shock response and the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and suppressing the NF-κB proinflammatory pathway (Cipollina 2015). Thus, these electrophilic derivatives transduce anti-inflammatory actions rather than suppress the production of pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid metabolites. An oxo-derivative of EPA has been shown to ablate leukemia stem cells in mice, which may represent a novel chemoprotective action for some oxo-derivatives (Hedge et al. 2011, Finch et al. 2015).

ROCK1 and ROCK2 phosphorylate many proteins involved in the stabilization of actin filaments and generation of actin-myosin contractile force, such as LIM kinases and myosin regulatory light chains (MRLC) (Amano et al. 1996, Ishizaki et al. 1996, Leung et al. 1996, Ohashi et al. 2000, Sumi et al. 2001, Riento and Ridley 2003, Watanabe et al. 2007).<p>PAK1, PAK2 and PAK3, members of the p21-activated kinase family, are activated by binding to RHO GTPases RAC1 and CDC42 and subsequent autophosphorylation and are involved in cytoskeleton regulation (Manser et al. 1994, Manser et al. 1995, Zhang et al. 1998, Edwards et al. 1999, Lei et al. 2000, Parrini et al. 2002; reviewed by Daniels and Bokoch 1999, Szczepanowska 2009).<p>RHOA, RHOB, RHOC and RAC1 activate protein kinase C related kinases (PKNs) PKN1, PKN2 and PKN3 (Maesaki et al. 1999, Zong et al. 1999, Owen et al. 2003, Modha et al. 2008, Hutchinson et al. 2011, Hutchinson et al. 2013), bringing them in proximity to the PIP3-activated PDPK1 (PDK1) and thus enabling PDPK1-mediated phosphorylation of PKN1, PKN2 and PKN3 (Flynn et al. 2000, Torbett et al. 2003). PKNs play important roles in cytoskeleton organization (Hamaguchi et al. 2000), regulation of cell cycle (Misaki et al. 2001), receptor trafficking (Metzger et al. 2003) and apoptosis (Takahashi et al. 1998). PKN1 is also involved in the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by the androgen receptor (Metzger et al. 2003, Metzger et al. 2005, Metzger et al. 2008).<p>Citron kinase (CIT) binds RHO GTPases RHOA, RHOB, RHOC and RAC1 (Madaule et al. 1995), but the mechanism of CIT activation by GTP-bound RHO GTPases has not been elucidated. CIT and RHOA are implicated to act together in Golgi apparatus organization through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (Camera et al. 2003). CIT is also involved in the regulation of cytokinesis through its interaction with KIF14 (Gruneberg et al. 2006, Bassi et al. 2013, Watanabe et al. 2013).<p>RHOA, RHOG, RAC1 and CDC42 bind kinectin (KTN1), a kinesin anchor protein involved in kinesin-mediated vesicle motility (Vignal et al. 2001, Hotta et al. 1996). The effect of RHOG activity on cellular morphology, exhibited in the formation of microtubule-dependent cellular protrusions, depends both on RHOG interaction with KTN1, as well as on the kinesin activity (Vignal et al. 2001). RHOG and KTN1 also cooperate in microtubule-dependent lysosomal transport (Vignal et al. 2001).<p>IQGAP proteins IQGAP1, IQGAP2 and IQGAP3, bind RAC1 and CDC42 and stabilize them in their GTP-bound state (Kuroda et al. 1996, Swart-Mataraza et al. 2002, Wang et al. 2007). IQGAPs bind F-actin filaments and modulate cell shape and motility through regulation of G-actin/F-actin equilibrium (Brill et al. 1996, Fukata et al. 1997, Bashour et al. 1997, Wang et al. 2007, Pelikan-Conchaudron et al. 2011). Binding of IQGAPs to F-actin is inhibited by calmodulin (Bashour et al. 1997, Pelikan-Conchaudron et al. 2011). IQGAP1 is involved in the regulation of adherens junctions through its interaction with E-cadherin (CDH1) and catenins (CTTNB1 and CTTNA1) (Kuroda et al. 1998, Hage et al. 2009). IQGAP1 contributes to cell polarity and lamellipodia formation through its interaction with microtubules (Fukata et al. 2002, Suzuki and Takahashi 2008).<p>RHOQ (TC10) regulates the trafficking of CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) by binding to the Golgi-associated protein GOPC (also known as PIST, FIG and CAL). In the absence of RHOQ, GOPC bound to CFTR directs CFTR for lysosomal degradation, while GTP-bound RHOQ directs GOPC:CFTR complex to the plasma membrane, thereby rescuing CFTR (Neudauer et al. 2001, Cheng et al. 2005).<p>RAC1 and CDC42 activate WASP and WAVE proteins, members of the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein family. WASPs and WAVEs simultaneously interact with G-actin and the actin-related ARP2/3 complex, acting as nucleation promoting factors in actin polymerization (reviewed by Lane et al. 2014).<p>RHOA, RHOB, RHOC, RAC1 and CDC42 activate a subset of formin family members. Once activated, formins bind G-actin and the actin-bound profilins and accelerate actin polymerization, while some formins also interact with microtubules. Formin-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization plays important roles in cell motility, organelle trafficking and mitosis (reviewed by Kuhn and Geyer 2014).<p>Rhotekin (RTKN) and rhophilins (RHPN1 and RHPN2) are effectors of RHOA, RHOB and RHOC and have not been studied in detail. They regulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and are implicated in the establishment of cell polarity, cell motility and possibly endosome trafficking (Sudo et al. 2006, Watanabe et al. 1996, Fujita et al. 2000, Peck et al. 2002, Mircescu et al. 2002). Similar to formins (Miralles et al. 2003), cytoskeletal changes triggered by RTKN activation may lead to stimulation of SRF-mediated transcription (Reynaud et al. 2000).<p>RHO GTPases RAC1 and RAC2 are needed for activation of NADPH oxidase complexes 1, 2 and 3 (NOX1, NOX2 and NOX3), membrane associated enzymatic complexes that use NADPH as an electron donor to reduce oxygen and produce superoxide (O2-). Superoxide serves as a secondary messenger and also directly contributes to the microbicidal activity of neutrophils (Knaus et al. 1991, Roberts et al. 1999, Kim and Dinauer 2001, Jyoti et al. 2014, Cheng et al. 2006, Miyano et al. 2006, Ueyama et al. 2006).''',

Patients with higher levels of GAA activity present later in life, often with symptoms restricted tocardiac and  skeletal muscle (Leslie & Tinkle). At a cellular level, symptoms of the disease are due to accumulation of structurally normal glycogen in lysosomes. Glycogen, thought to enter lysosomes via autophagy, is fully degraded by GAA (Brown et al. 1970), but accumulates if the enzyme is absent or reduced in activity.<p>The two mutant alleles annotated here are associated with near-complete loss of enzyme activity and early onset of disease (Hermans et al. 1991; Zhong et al. 1991).

The gene encoding GUSB is 21 kb long, contains 12 exons and gives rise to two different types of cDNAs, through an alternate splicing mechanism (Miller et al. 1990). It maps to 7q11.21-q11.22 (Speleman et al. 1996). The phenotype is highly variable, ranging from severe causing death, non-immune hydrops fetalis (Vervoort et al. 1996) to mild forms with survival into adulthood (Storch et al. 2003).

    372786: '''G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs; 7TM receptors; seven transmembrane domain receptors; heptahelical receptors; G protein-linked receptors [GPLR]) are the largest family of transmembrane receptors in humans, accounting for more than 1% of the protein-coding capacity of the human genome. All known GPCRs share a common architecture of seven membrane-spanning helices connected by intra- and extracellular loops. The extracellular loops contain two highly-conserved cysteine residues that form disulphide bonds to stabilize the structure of the receptor. They recognize diverse messengers such as light, odorants, small molecules, hormones and neurotransmitters. Most GPCRs act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors; activated by ligand binding, they promote GDP-GTP exchange on associated heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins. There are two models for GPCR-G Protein interactions: 1) ligand-GPCR binding first, then binding to G Proteins; 2) "Pre-coupling" of GPCRs and G Proteins before ligand binding (review Oldham WM and Hamm HE, 2008). These in turn activate effector enzymes or ion channels. GPCRs are involved in a range of physiological roles which include the visual sense, smell, behavioural regulation, functions of the autonomic nervous system and regulation of the immune system and inflammation.<br>GPCRs are divided into  classes based on sequence homology and functional similarity.  The main mammalian classes, in order of size, are the Rhodopsin-like family A, the Secretin receptor family B, and the Metabotropic glutamate/pheromone receptor family C. ''',

    1986613: '''8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome (EMS) is an aggressive disorder that is associated with a translocation event at the FGFR1 gene on chromosome 8p11.  Typical symptoms upon diagnosis include eosinophilia and associated T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma; the disease rapidly advances to acute leukemia, usually of myeloid lineage.  At present the only effective treatment is allogenic stem cell transplantation (reviewed in Jackson, 2010).  <br><br>At the molecular level, EMS appears to be caused by translocation events on chromosome 8 that create gene fusions between the intracellular domain of FGFR1 and an N-terminal partner gene that encodes a dimerization domain.  The resulting fusion protein dimerizes in a ligand-independent fashion based the N-terminal domain provided by the partner protein and stimulates constititutive downstream FGFR1 signaling without altering the intrisic kinase activity of the receptor.  To date, 11 partner genes have been identified: ZMYM2, FGFR1OP, FGFR1OP2, HERVK, TRIM24, CUX1, BCR, CEP110, LRRFIP1, MYO18A and CPSF6, although not all have been functionally characterized (reviewed in Jackson, 2010, Turner and Grose, 2010; Wesche, 2011).  <br>Where examined, cell lines carrying FGFR1 fusion genes have been shown to be transforming  and to support IL3-independent proliferation through anti-apoptotic, prosurvival pathways(Lelievre, 2008; Ollendorff, 1999; Chase, 2007; Guasch, 2001; Wasag 2011; Roumiantsev, 2004; Demiroglu, 2001; Smedley, 1999).  Signaling appears to occur predominantly through PLCgamma, PI3K and STAT signaling, with a more minor contribution from MAPK activation.  Because the fusion proteins lack the FRS2-binding site, the mechanism of MAPK activation is unclear.  Recruitment of  GRB2:SOS1 through recruitment of SHC is one possibility (Guasch, 2001).''',

    6791224: '''In humans, a 47S precursor rRNA (pre-rRNA) is transcribed by RNA polymerase I from rRNA-encoding genes (rDNA) at the boundary of the fibrillar center and the dense fibrillar components of the nucleolus (Stanek et al. 2001). The 47S precursor is processed over the course of about 5-8 minutes (Popov et al. 2013) by endoribonucleases and exoribonucleases to yield the 28S rRNA and 5.8S rRNA of the 60S subunit and the 18S rRNA of the 40S subunit (reviewed in Mullineus and Lafontaine 2012, Henras et al. 2015). As the pre-rRNA is being transcribed, a large protein complex, the small subunit (SSU) processome, assembles in the region of the 18S rRNA sequence, forming terminal knobs on the pre-rRNA (reviewed in Phipps et al. 2011, inferred from yeast in Dragon et al. 2002). The SSU processome contains both ribosomal proteins of the small subunit and processing factors which process the pre-rRNA and modify nucleotides. Through addition of subunits the SSU processome appears to be converted into the larger 90S pre-ribosome (inferred from yeast in Grandi et al. 2002). An analogous large subunit processome (LSU) assembles in the region of the 28S rRNA, however the LSU is less well characterized (inferred from yeast in McCann et al. 2015).<br>Following cleavage of the pre-rRNA within internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), the pre-ribosomal particle separates into a pre-60S subunit and a pre-40S subunit in the nucleolus (reviewed in Hernandez-Verdun et al. 2010, Phipps et al. 2011). The pre-60S and pre-40S ribosomal particles are then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where the processing factors dissociate and recycle back to the nucleus<br>Nuclease digestions of the 47S pre-rRNA can follow several paths. In the major pathway, the ends of the 47S pre-rRNA are trimmed to yield the 45S pre-rRNA. Digestion at site 2  (also called site 2b in mouse, see Henras et al. 2015 for nomenclature) cleaves the 45S pre-rRNA to yield the 30S pre-rRNA containing the 18S rRNA of the small subunit and the 32S pre-rRNA containing the 5.8S rRNA and the 28S rRNA of the large subunit. The 32S pre-rRNA is digested in the nucleus to yield the 5.8S rRNA and the 28S rRNA while the 30S pre-rRNA is digested in the nucleus to yield the 18SE pre-rRNA which is then processed in the nucleus and cytosol to yield the 18S rRNA. At least 286 human proteins, 74 of which have no yeast homolog, are required for efficient processing of pre-rRNA in the nucleus (Tafforeau et al. 2013)''',
    5578805: '''In phase 3 (the "rapid repolarisation" phase), the L-type Ca2+ channels close, while the slow delayed rectifier (I<sub>Ks</sub>) K+ channels remain open as more K+ leak channels open. This ensures a net outward positive current, corresponding to negative change in membrane potential, thus allowing more types of K+ channels to open. These are primarily the rapid delayed rectifier K+ channels (I<sub>Kr</sub>) and the inwardly rectifying K+ current, I<sub>K1</sub> (Kir). This net outward, positive current (equal to loss of positive charge from the cell) causes the cell to repolarize. The primary delayed rectifier K+ currents (I<sub>Ks</sub> and I<sub>Kr</sub>) are generated by K+ efflux mediated by potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily KQT member 1 (KCNQ1 aka Kv7.1) and potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2 (KCNH2 aka HERG) channels respectively (Park & Fishman 2011, Grant 2009).

IL21 binds Interleukin-21 receptor (IL21R, NILR) and Cytokine receptor common subunit gamma (IL2RG, GammaC).<br>IL21R has significant homology with the class I cytokine receptors Interleukin-2 receptor subunit beta (IL2RB) and Interleukin-4 receptor subunit alpha (IL4R) and was predicted to similarly form a complex with IL2RG. IL21R dimers can weakly bind and signal in response to IL21 but IL21 generates a much stronger response when IL21R is combined with IL2RG, which is required for a fully signaling capable IL21 receptor complex (Ozaki et al. 2000, Asao et al. 2001, Habib et al. 2002). IL21R can bind Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) (Ozaki et al. 2000) but IL2RG is required for IL21 induced signaling (Asao et al. 2001). The heteromeric IL21 receptor complex can activate JAK1, JAK3, Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), STAT3, STAT4 and STAT5, depending on the cell type.

Whereas myoglobin contains pentacoordinated heme iron, neuroglobin and cytoglobin contain hexacoordinated heme iron: the iron atom is bound by 4 nitrogen atoms of heme and 2 histidine residues of the globin. Binding by one of the histidines is reversible, which allows the iron atom to bind various ligands such as molecular oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide (reviewed in Kakar et al. 2010). Neuroglobin may function in oxygen homeostasis, however the importance of its oxygen-binding activity is unclear (reviewed in Pesce et al. 2002, Hankeln et al. 2005). Cytoglobin may function in nitric oxide metabolism (Thuy et al. 2016, Liu et al. 2017). Globins can also regulate oxygen homeostasis via reactions with nitric oxide (NO), a vasodilator. Oxygenated globins scavenge NO by oxidation while deoxygenated globins can act as a nitrite reductase to produce NO (reviewed in Hendgen-Cotta et al. 2014, Tejero and Gladwin 2014). ''',

Genes regulated by retinoids are essential for reproduction, embryonic development, growth, and multiple processes in the adult, including energy balance, neurogenesis, and the immune response. The retinoid used as a cofactor in the visual cycle  is 11-cis-retinal (11cRAL).

The IFNA/B stimulation of the IFNA receptor complex leads to the formation of two transcriptional activator complexes: IFNA-activated-factor (AAF), which is a homodimer of STAT1 and IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which comprises STAT1, STAT2 and a member of the IRF family, IRF9/P48. AAF mediates activation of the IRF-1 gene by binding to GAS (IFNG-activated site), whereas ISGF3 activates several IFN-inducible genes including IRF3 and IRF7.''',

    9031767: '''Erythropoietin (EPO) is a cytokine that serves as the primary regulator of erythropoiesis, the differentiation of erythrocytes from stem cells in the liver of the fetus and the bone marrow of adult mammals (reviewed in Ingley 2012, Zhang et al. 2014, Kuhrt and Wojchowski 2015). EPO is produced in the kidneys in response to low oxygen tension and binds a receptor, EPOR, located on progenitor cells: burst forming unit-erythroid (BFU-e) cells and colony forming unit-erythroid (CFU-e) cells.<br>The erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) exists in lipid rafts (reviewed in McGraw and List 2017) as a dimer pre-associated with proteins involved in downstream signaling: the tyrosine kinase JAK2, the tyrosine kinase LYN, and the scaffold protein IRS2. Binding of EPO to the EPOR dimer causes a change in conformation (reviewed in Watowich et al. 2011, Corbett et al. 2016) that activates JAK2, which then transphosphorylates JAK2 and phosphorylates the cytoplasmic domain of EPOR. The phosphorylated EPOR serves directly or indirectly as a docking site for signaling molecules such as STAT5, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C gamma (PLCG1, PLCG2), and activators of RAS (SHC1, GRB2:SOS1, GRB2:VAV1).<br>EPO activates 4 major signaling pathways: STAT5-activated transcription, PI3K-AKT, RAS-RAF-ERK, and PLC-PKC. JAK2-STAT5 activates expression of BCL2L1 (Bcl-xL) and therefore appears to be important for anti-apoptosis. PI3K-AKT appears to be important for both anti-apoptosis and proliferation. The roles of other signaling pathways are controversial but both RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and PLCgamma-PKC have mitogenic effects. Phosphatases such as SHP1 are also recruited and downregulate the EPO signal.<br>EPO also has effects outside of erythropoiesis. The EPOR is expressed in various tissues such as endothelium where it can act to stimulate growth and promote cell survival (Debeljak et al. 2014, Kimáková et al. 2017).

    1650785: '''The biosynthesis of collagen is a multistep process. Collagen propeptides are cotranslationally translocated into the ER lumen. Propeptides undergo a number of post-translational modifications. Proline and lysine residues may be hydroxylated by prolyl 3-, prolyl 4- and lysyl hydroxylases. 4-hydroxyproline is essential for intramolecular hydrogen bonding and stability of the triple helical collagenous domain. In fibril forming collagens approximately 50% of prolines are 4-hydroxylated; the extent of this and of 3-hydroxyproline and lysine hydroxylation varies between tissues and collagen types (Kivirikko et al. 1972, 1992). Hydroxylysine molecules can form cross-links between collagen molecules in fibrils, and are sites for glycosyl- and galactosylation. Collagen peptides all have non-collagenous domains; collagens within the subclasses have common chain structures. These non-collagenous domains have regulatory functions; some are biologically active when cleaved from the main peptide chain. Fibrillar collagens all have a large triple helical domain (COL1) bordered by N and C terminal extensions, called the N and C propeptides, which are cleaved prior to formation of the collagen fibril. The C propeptide, also called the NC1 domain, is highly conserved. It directs chain association during intracellular assembly of the procollagen molecule from three collagen propeptide alpha chains (Hulmes 2002). The N-propeptide has a short linker (NC2) connecting the main triple helix to a short minor one (COL2) and a globular N-terminal region NC3. NC3 domains are variable both in size and the domains they contain.<br><br>Collagen propeptides typically undergo a number of post-translational modifications. Proline and lysine residues are hydroxylated by prolyl 3-, prolyl 4- and lysyl hydroxylases. 4-hydroxyproline is essential for intramolecular hydrogen bonding and stability of the triple helical collagenous domain. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase may also have a role in alpha chain association as no association of the C-propeptides of type XII collagen was seen in the presence of prolyl 4-hydroxylase inhibitors (Mazzorana et al. 1993, 1996). In fibril forming collagens approximately 50% of prolines are 4-hydroxylated; the extent of this is species dependent, lower hydroxylation correlating with lower ambient temperature and thermal stability (Cohen-Solal et al. 1986, Notbohm et al. 1992). Similarly the extent of 3-hydroxyproline and lysine hydroxylation varies between tissues and collagen types (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Hydroxylysine molecules can form cross-links between collagen molecules in fibrils, and are sites for glycosyl- and galactosylation.<br><br>Collagen molecules fold and assemble through a series of distinct intermediates (Bulleid 1996). Individual collagen polypeptide chains are translocated co-translationally across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Intra-chain disulfide bonds are formed within the N-propeptide, and hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues occurs within the triple helical domain (Kivirikko et al. 1992). When the peptide chain is fully translocated into the ER lumen the C-propeptide folds, the conformation being stabilized by intra-chain disulfide bonds (Doege and Fessler 1986). Pro alpha-chains associate via the C-propeptides (Byers et al. 1975, Bachinger et al. 1978), or NC2 domains for FACIT family collagens (Boudko et al. 2008) to form an initial trimer which can be stabilized by the formation of inter-chain disulfide bonds (Schofield et al. 1974, Olsen et al. 1976), though these are not a prerequisite for further folding (Bulleid et al. 1996). The triple helix then nucleates and folds in a C- to N- direction. The association of the individual chains and subsequent triple helix formation are distinct steps (Bachinger et al. 1980). The N-propeptides associate and in some cases form inter-chain disulfide bonds (Bruckner et al., 1978). Procollagen is released via carriers into the exracellular space (Canty & Kadler 2005). Fibrillar procollagens undergo removal of the C- and N-propeptides by procollagen C and N proteinases respectively, both Zn2+ dependent metalloproteinases. Propeptide processing is a required step for normal collagen I and III fibril formation, but collagens can retain some or all of their non-collagenous propeptides. Retained collagen type V and XI N-propeptides contribute to the control of fibril growth by sterically limiting lateral molecule addition (Fichard et al. 1995). Processed fibrillar procollagen is termed tropocollagen, which is considered to be the unit of higher order fibrils and fibres. Tropocollagens of the fibril forming collagens I, II, III, V and XI sponteneously aggregate in vitro in a manner that has been compared with crystallization, commencing with a nucleation event followed by subsequent organized aggregation (Silver et al. 1992, Prockop & Fertala 1998). Fibril formation is stabilized by lysyl oxidase catalyzed crosslinks between adjacent molecules (Siegel &  Fu 1976).''',

    176245: '''Genotoxic stress caused by DNA damage or stalled replication forks can lead to genomic instability. To guard against such instability, genotoxically-stressed cells activate checkpoint factors that halt or slow cell cycle progression. Among the pathways affected are DNA replication by reduction of replication origin firing, and mitosis by inhibiting activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). A key factor involved in the response to stalled replication forks is the ATM- and rad3-related (ATR) kinase, a member of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family. Rather than responding to particular lesions in DNA, ATR and its binding partner ATRIP (ATR-interacting protein) sense replication fork stalling indirectly by associating with persistent ssDNA bound by RPA. These structures would be formed, for example, by dissociation of the replicative helicase from the leading or lagging strand DNA polymerase when the polymerase encounters a DNA lesion that blocks DNA synthesis. Along with  phosphorylating the downstream transducer kinase Chk1 and the tumor suppressor p53, activated ATR modifies numerous factors that regulate cell cycle progression or the repair of DNA damage. The persistent ssDNA also stimulates recruitment of the RFC-like Rad17-Rfc2-5 alternative clamp-loading complex, which subsequently loads the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 complex onto the DNA. The latter '9-1-1' complex serves to facilitate Chk1 binding to the stalled replication fork, where Chk1 is phosphorylated by ATR and thereby activated. Upon activation, Chk1 can phosphorylate additional substrates including the Cdc25 family of phosphatases (Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C). These enzymes catalyze the removal of inhibitory phosphate residues from cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), allowing their activation. In particular, Cdc25A primarily functions at the G1/S transition to dephosphorylate Cdk2 at Thr 14 and Tyr 15, thus positively regulating the Cdk2-cyclin E complex for S-phase entry.  Cdc25A also has mitotic functions. Phosphorylation of Cdc25A at Ser125 by Chk1 leads to Cdc25A ubiquitination and degradation, thus inhibiting DNA replication origin firing. In contrast, Cdc25B and Cdc25C regulate the onset of mitosis through dephosphorylation and activation of Cdk1-cyclin B complexes. In response to replication stress, Chk1 phosphorylates Cdc25B and Cdc25C leading to Cdc25B/C complex formation with 14-3-3 proteins. As these complexes are sequestered in the cytoplasm, they are unable to activate the nuclear Cdk1-cyclin B complex for mitotic entry.<p>These events are outlined in the figure. Persistent single-stranded DNA associated with RPA binds claspin (A) and ATR:ATRIP (B), leading to claspin phosphorylation (C). In parallel, the same single-stranded DNA:RPA complex binds RAD17:RFC (D), enabling the loading of RAD9:HUS1:RAD1 (9-1-1) complex onto the DNA (E). The resulting complex of proteins can then repeatedly bind (F) and phosphorylate (G) CHK1, activating multiple copies of CHK1.''',

A primary one is delivered by the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex after antigen recognition and additional costimulatory signals are delivered by the engagement of costimulatory receptors such as CD28.

    3465346: '''c-FLIP proteins (CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulators or c-FLICE inhibitory proteins) are death effector domain (DED)-containing proteins that are recruited to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) to regulate activation of caspases-8. Three out of 13 distinct spliced variants of c-FLIP had been found to be expressed at the protein level, the 26 kDa short form FLIP(S), the 24 kDa form FLIP(R), and the 55 kDa long form FLIP(L) (Irmler M et al. 1997; Shu HB et al. 1997; Srinivasula SM et al. 1997; Scaffidi C et al. 1999; Golks A et al. 2005; Haag C et al. 2011)<p>All c-FLIP proteins carry two DEDs at their N termini, which can bind FADD and procaspase-8. In addition to two DEDs, FLIP(L) contains a large (p20) and a small (p12) caspase-like domain without catalytic activity. FLIP(S) and FLIP(R) consist of two DEDs and a small C terminus. Depending on its level of expression FLIP(L) may function as an anti-apoptotic or pro-apoptotic factor, while FLIP(S) and FLIP(R) protect cells from apoptosis by blocking the processing of caspase-8 at the receptor level (Scaffidi C et al. 1999; Golks A et al. 2005; Toivonen HT et al. 2011; Fricker N et al. 2010).''',
    73858: '''RNA polymerase (Pol) I (one of three eukaryotic nuclear RNA polymerases) is devoted to the transcription of the ribosomal DNA genes, which are found in multiple arrayed copies in every eukaryotic cell. These genes encode for the large ribosomal RNA precursor, which is then processed into the three largest subunits of the ribosomal RNA, the 18S, 28S, and 5.8S RNAs. In human cells the rDNA gene clusters are localized on the short arm of the five pairs of the acrocentric chromosomes.  The rRNA promoter has two essential and specially spaced sequences: a CORE element and an upstream control element (UCE, also called UPE). The CORE element of the human promoter overlaps with the transcription start site, extending from 20 to 45, and is required for specific initiation of transcription. <br>

The polymerase is a multisubunit complex, composed of two large subunits (the most conserved portions include the catalytic site that shares similarity with other eukaryotic and bacterial multisubunit RNA polymerases) and a number of smaller subunits. Under a number of experimental conditions the core is competent to mediate ribonucleic acid synthesis, in vivo however, it requires additional factors to select the appropriate template. In humans the RNA transcript (45S) is approximately 13,000 nucleotides long. Before leaving the nucleus as assembled ribosomal particles, the 45S rRNA is cleaved to give one copy each of the 28S rRNA, the 18S rRNA, and the 5.8S rRNA. Equal quantities of the three rRNAs are produced by initially transcribing them as one transcript.''',

    1257607: '''ERBB4, also known as HER4, belongs to the ERBB family of receptors, which also includes ERBB1 (EGFR i.e. HER1), ERBB2 (HER2 i.e. NEU) and ERBB3 (HER3). Similar to EGFR, ERBB4 has an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain which contains an active tyrosine kinase and a C-tail with multiple phosphorylation sites. At least three and possibly four splicing isoforms of ERBB4 exist that differ in their C-tail and/or the extracellular juxtamembrane regions: ERBB4 JM-A CYT1, ERBB4 JM-A CYT2 and ERBB4 JM-B CYT1 (the existence of ERBB4 JM-B CYT2 has not been confirmed). <br><br>ERBB4 becomes activated by binding one of its seven ligands, three of which, HB-EGF, epiregulin EPR and betacellulin BTC, are EGF-like (Elenius et al. 1997, Riese et al. 1998), while four, NRG1, NRG2, NRG3 and NRG4, belong to the neuregulin family (Tzahar et al. 1994, Carraway et al. 1997, Zhang et al. 1997, Hayes et al. 2007). Upon ligand binding, ERBB4 forms homodimers (Sweeney et al. 2000) or it heterodimerizes with ERBB2 (Li et al. 2007). Dimers of ERBB4 undergo trans-autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues in the C-tail (Cohen et al. 1996, Kaushansky et al. 2008, Hazan et al. 1990, Li et al. 2007), triggering downstream signaling cascades. The pathway Signaling by ERBB4 only shows signaling by ERBB4 homodimers. Signaling by heterodimers of ERBB4 and ERBB2 is shown in the pathway Signaling by ERBB2. Ligand-stimulated ERBB4 is also able to form heterodimers with ligand-stimulated EGFR (Cohen et al. 1996) and ligand-stimulated ERBB3 (Riese et al. 1995). Dimers of ERBB4 with EGFR and dimers of ERBB4 with ERBB3 were demonstrated in mouse cell lines in which human ERBB4 and EGFR or ERBB3 were exogenously expressed. These heterodimers undergo trans-autophosphorylation, but their downstream signaling and physiological significance have not been studied. <br><br><br>All splicing isoforms of ERBB4 possess two tyrosine residues in the C-tail that serve as docking sites for SHC1 (Kaushansky et al. 2008, Pinkas-Kramarski et al. 1996, Cohen et al. 1996). Once bound to ERBB4, SHC1 becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by the tyrosine kinase activity of ERBB4, which enables it to recruit the complex of GRB2 and SOS1, resulting in the guanyl-nucleotide exchange on RAS and activation of RAF and MAP kinase cascade (Kainulainen et al. 2000). <br><br>The CYT1 isoforms of ERBB4 also possess a C-tail tyrosine residue that, upon trans-autophosphorylation, serves as a docking site for the p85 alpha subunit of PI3K (Kaushansky et al. 2008, Cohen et al. 1996), leading to assembly of an active PI3K complex that converts PIP2 to PIP3 and activates AKT signaling (Kainulainen et al. 2000). <br><br>Besides signaling as a transmembrane receptor, ligand activated homodimers of ERBB4 JM-A isoforms (ERBB4 JM-A CYT1 and ERBB4 JM-A CYT2) undergo proteolytic cleavage by ADAM17 (TACE) in the juxtamembrane region, resulting in shedding of the extracellular domain and formation of an 80 kDa membrane bound ERBB4 fragment known as ERBB4 m80 (Rio et al. 2000, Cheng et al. 2003). ERBB4 m80 undergoes further proteolytic cleavage, mediated by the gamma-secretase complex, which releases the soluble 80 kDa ERBB4 intracellular domain, known as ERBB4 s80 or E4ICD, into the cytosol (Ni et al. 2001). ERBB4 s80 is able to translocate to the nucleus, promote nuclear translocation of various transcription factors, and act as a transcription co-factor. ERBB4 plays and important role in the development of the nervous system. In neuronal precursors, ERBB4 s80 binds the complex of TAB and NCOR1, helps to move the complex into the nucleus, and is a co-factor of TAB:NCOR1-mediated inhibition of expression of astrocyte differentiation genes GFAP and S100B (Sardi et al. 2006). Erbb4 deficiency in somatostatin-expressing neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus alters behaviors dependent on sensory selection (Ahrens et al. 2015). NRG1-activated ERBB4 signaling enhances AMPA receptor responses through PKC-dependent AMPA receptor exocytosis. This results in an increased excitatory input to parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex and regulates visual cortical plasticity (Sun et al. 2016). NRG1-activated ERBB4 signaling is involved in GABAergic activity in amygdala which mediates fear conditioning (fear memory) (Lu et al. 2014). Conditional Erbb4 deletion from fast-spiking interneurons, chandelier and basket cells, of the cerebral cortex leads to synaptic defects associated with increased locomotor activity and abnormal emotional, social and cognitive function that can be linked to some of the schizophrenia features. The level of GAD1 (GAD67) protein is reduced in the cortex of conditional Erbb4 mutants. GAD1 is a GABA synthesizing enzyme. Cortical mRNA levels of GAD67 are consistently decreased in schizophrenia (Del Pino et al. 2014). Erbb4 is expressed in the GABAergic neurons of the bed nucleus stria terminalis, a part of the extended amygdala. Inhibition of NRG1-triggered ERBB4 signaling induces anxiety-like behavior, which depends on GABAergic neurotransmission. NRG1-ERBB4 signaling stimulates presynaptic GABA release, but the exact mechanism is not known (Geng et al. 2016). NRG1 protects cortical interneurons against ischemic brain injury through ERBB4-mediated increase in GABAergic transmission (Guan et al. 2015). NRG2-activated ERBB4 can reduce the duration of GABAergic transmission by binding to GABA receptors at the postsynaptic membrane via their GABRA1 subunit and promoting endocytosis of GABA receptors (Mitchell et al. 2013). NRG1 promotes synchronization of prefrontal cortex interneurons in an ERBB4 dependent manner (Hou et al. 2014). NRG1-ERBB4 signaling protects neurons from the cell death induced by a mutant form of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Woo et al. 2012).<br>In mammary cells, ERBB4 s80 recruits STAT5A transcription factor in the cytosol, shuttles it to the nucleus, and acts as the STAT5A co-factor in binding to and promoting transcription from the beta-casein (CSN2) promoter, and may be involved in the regulation of other lactation-related genes (Williams et al. 2004, Muraoka-Cook et al. 2008). ERBB4 s80 was also shown to bind activated estrogen receptor in the nucleus and act as its transcriptional co-factor in promoting transcription of some estrogen-regulated genes, such as progesterone receptor gene NR3C3 and CXCL12 i.e. SDF1 (Zhu et al. 2006). In human breast cancer cell lines, ERBB4 activation enhances anchorage-independent colony formation in soft agar but inhibits cell growth in a monolayer culture. Different ERBB4 ligands induce different gene expression changes in breast cancer cell lines. Some of the genes induced in response to ERBB4 signaling in breast cancer cell lines are RAB2, EPS15R and GATA4. It is not known if these gene are direct transcriptional targets of ERBB4 (Amin et al. 2004).<br>ERBB4 increases activity of the transcription factor SREBF2, resulting in increased expression of SREBF2-target genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. The mechanism is not known and may involve facilitation of SREBF2 cleavage through ERBB4-mediated PI3K signaling (Haskins et al. 2016).<br><br>The C-tail of ERBB4 possesses several WW-domain binding motifs (three in CYT1 isoform and two in CYT2 isoform), which enable interaction of ERBB4 with WW-domain containing proteins. ERBB4 s80, through WW-domain binding motifs, interacts with YAP1 transcription factor, a known proto-oncogene, and may be a co-regulator of YAP1-mediated transcription (Komuro et al. 2003, Omerovic et al. 2004). The tumor suppressor WWOX, another WW-domain containing protein, competes with YAP1 in binding to ERBB4 s80 and prevents translocation of ERBB4 s80 to the nucleus (Aqeilan et al. 2005). ERBB4 s80 is also able to translocate to the mitochondrial matrix, presumably when its nuclear translocation is inhibited. Once in the mitochondrion, the BH3 domain of ERBB4, characteristic of BCL2 family members, may enable it to act as a pro-apoptotic factor (Naresh et al. 2006). Activation of ERBB4 in breast cancer cell lines leads to JNK-dependent increase in BRCA1 mRNA level and mitotic cell cycle delay, but the exact mechanism has not been elucidated (Muraoka-Cook et al. 2006).   <br><br>WW-domain binding motifs in the C-tail of ERBB4 play an important role in the downregulation of ERBB4 receptor signaling, enabling the interaction of intact ERBB4, ERBB4 m80 and ERBB4 s80 with NEDD4 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases WWP1 and ITCH. The interaction of WWP1 and ITCH with intact ERBB4 is independent of receptor activation and autophosphorylation. Binding of WWP1 and ITCH ubiquitin ligases leads to ubiquitination of ERBB4 and its cleavage products, and subsequent degradation through both proteasomal and lysosomal routes (Omerovic et al. 2007, Feng et al. 2009). In addition, the s80 cleavage product of ERBB4 JM-A CYT-1 isoform is the target of NEDD4 ubiquitin ligase. NEDD4 binds ERBB4 JM-A CYT-1 s80 (ERBB4jmAcyt1s80) through its PIK3R1 interaction site and mediates ERBB4jmAcyt1s80 ubiquitination, thereby decreasing the amount of ERBB4jmAcyt1s80 that reaches the nucleus (Zeng et al. 2009).

Based on studies with inhibitors of G proteins such as pertussis toxin FFAR1 is believed to signal through Gq/11. Binding of free fatty acids by  FFAR1 activates the heterotrimeric Gq complex which then activates Phospholipase C, producing inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and eventually causing the release of intracellular calcium into the cytosol. From experiments in knockout mice it is estimated that signaling through FFAR1 is responsible for about 50% of the augmentation of insulin secretion produced by free fatty acids.''',

Although cone photoreceptors make up around 5% of all photoreceptor cells and are outnumbered 20 to 1 by rod photoreceptors, they mediate daylight vision in the human eye whereas rods mediate twilight vision. Also, cones are around 100-times less light-sensitive than rods thereby depriving us of colour vision in dark conditions in which cones cannot function. Rod function saturates in even moderate amounts of light whereas cones can adjust to even very bright light conditions, a process called light adaptation. In bright conditions, rods can take up to one hour to regain their sensitivity whereas cones can recover in a few minutes, a process called dark adaptation and which allows us to retain visual perception in changing light conditions.<br><br>Cone cells express three types of opsin which allow colour discrimination. Long Wavelength Sensitive Opsin (OPN1LW) detects red , Short Wavelength Sensitive Opsin (OPN1SW) detects blue, and Medium Wavelength Sensitive Opsin (OPN1MW) detects green regions of the light spectrum.<br><br>In the canonical retinoid (visual) cycle, the visual chromophore is regenerated in reactions involving the rod outer segments (ROS) and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). For cones, chromophore recycling is independent of the RPE and instead involves Muller cells in the retina which supply the chromophore selectively to cones. The molecular steps of the cone retinoid (visual) cycle are outlined in this section. The ability of cones to react to bright and differing light conditions means it has to regenerate the chromophore much quicker than rods. All-trans-retinol (atROL) released from cone outer segments is taken up by Muller cells where it is directly isomerized back to 11-cis-retinol (11cROL) then esterified by LRAT. When required, these 11-cis-retinyl esters can be hydrolysed by 11-cis-RE hydrolases back to 11cROL then oxidised in the cone photoreceptor cell to regenerate 11-cis-retinal (11cRAL), the visual chromophore (see reviews von Lintig 2012, Wang & Kefalov 2011, Kefalov 2012, Wolf 2004).''',

    5693588: '''Homology directed repair (HDR) through homologous recombination (HRR) or single strand annealing (SSA) requires extensive resection of DNA double strand break (DSB) ends (Thompson and Limoli 2003, Ciccia and Elledge 2010). The resection is performed in a two-step process, where the MRN complex (MRE11A:RAD50:NBN) and RBBP8 (CtIP) bound to BRCA1 initiate the resection. This step is regulated by the complex of CDK2 and CCNA (cyclin A), ensuring the initiation of HRR during S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, when sister chromatids are available. The initial resection is also regulated by ATM-mediated phosphorylation of RBBP8 and CHEK2-mediated phosphorylation of BRCA1 (Chen et al. 2008, Yun and Hiom 2009, Buis et al. 2012, Wang et al. 2013, Davies et al. 2015, Parameswaran et al. 2015).

It was originally identified by its ability to stimulate the development of the mammary gland and lactation, but is now known to have numerous and varied functions (Bole-Feysot et al. 1998). Despite this, few pathologies have been associated with abnormalities in prolactin receptor (PRLR) signaling, though roles in various forms of cancer and certain autoimmune disorders have been suggested (Goffin et al. 2002). A vast body of literature suggests effects of PRL in immune cells (Matera 1996) but PRLR KO mice have unaltered immune system development and function (Bouchard et al. 1999). In addition to the pituitary, numerous other tissues produce PRL, including the decidua and myometrium, certain cells of the immune system, brain, skin and exocrine glands such as the mammary, sweat and lacrimal glands (Ben-Jonathan et al. 1996). Pituitary PRL secretion is negatively regulated by inhibitory factors originating from the hypothalamus, the most important of which is dopamine, acting through the D2 subclass of dopamine receptors present in lactotrophs (Freeman et al. 2000). PRL-binding sites or receptors have been identified in numerous cells and tissues of adult mammals. Various forms of PRLR, generated by alternative splicing, have been reported in several species including humans (Kelly et al. 1991, Clevenger et al. 2003).<br><br>PRLR is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily. Like many other members of this family, the first step in receptor activation was generally believed to be ligand-induced dimerization whereby one molecule of PRL bound to two molecules of receptor (Elkins et al. 2000). Recent reports suggest that PRLR pre-assembles at the plasma membrane in the absence of ligand (Gadd & Clevenger 2006, Tallet et al. 2011), suggesting that ligand-induced activation involves conformational changes in preformed PRLR dimers (Broutin et al. 2010). <br><br>PRLR has no intrinsic kinase activity but associates (Lebrun et al. 1994, 1995) with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) which is activated following receptor activation (Campbell et al. 1994, Rui et al. 1994, Carter-Su et al. 2000, Barua et al. 2009). JAK2-dependent activation of JAK1 has also been reported (Neilson et al. 2007). It is generally accepted that activation of JAK2 occurs by transphosphorylation upon ligand-induced receptor activation, based on JAK activation by chimeric receptors in which various extracellular domains of cytokine or tyrosine kinase receptors were fused to the IL-2 receptor beta chain (see Ihle et al. 1994). This activation step involves the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, which in turn phosphorylates PRLR on specific intracellular tyrosine residues leading to STAT5 recruitment and signaling, considered to be the most important signaling cascade for PRLR. STAT1 and STAT3 activation have also been reported (DaSilva et al. 1996) as have many other signaling pathways; signaling through MAP kinases (Shc/SOS/Grb2/Ras/Raf/MAPK) has been reported as a consequence of PRL stimuilation in many different cellular systems (see Bole-Feysot et al. 1998) though it is not clear how this signal is propagated. Other cascades non exhaustively include Src kinases, Focal adhesion kinase, phospholipase C gamma, PI3 kinase/Akt and Nek3 (Clevenger et al. 2003, Miller et al. 2007). The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 is recruited to the C terminal tyrosine of PRLR and may have a regulatory role (Ali & Ali 2000). PRLR phosphotyrosines can recruit insulin receptor substrates (IRS) and other adaptor proteins to the receptor complex (Bole-Feysot et al. 1998).<br><br>Female homozygous PRLR knockout mice are completely infertile and show a lack of mammary development (Ormandy et al. 1997). Hemizogotes are unable to lactate following their first pregnancy and depending on the genetic background, this phenotype can persist through subsequent pregnancies (Kelly et al. 2001).''',

    5693601: '''The presynaptic phase of homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange begins with the displacement of RPA from 3'-ssDNA overhangs created by extensive resection of DNA double strand break (DSB) ends. RPA is displaced by the joint action of RAD51 and BRCA2. BRCA2 nucleates RAD51 on 3'-ssDNA overhangs, leading to formation of invasive RAD51 nucleofilaments which are stabilized by the BCDX2 complex (RAD51B:RAD51C:RAD51D:XRCC2). Stable synaptic pairing between recombining DNA molecules involves the invasion of the homologous sister chromatid duplex DNA by the RAD51 nucleofilament and base-pairing between the invading ssDNA and the complementary sister chromatid DNA strand, while the non-complementary strand of the sister chromatid DNA duplex is displaced. This results in the formation of a D-loop structure (Sung et al., 2003). PALB2 and RAD51AP1 synergistically stimulate RAD51 recombinase activity and D-loop formation. PALB2 simultaneously interacts with RAD51, BRCA2 and RAD51AP1 (Modesti et al. 2007, Wiese et al. 2007, Buisson et al. 2010, Dray et al. 2010). PALB2 also interacts with BRCA1, and this interaction fine-tunes the localization of BRCA2 and RAD51 at DNA DSBs (Zhang et al. 2009, Sy et al. 2009). The CX3 complex, composed of RAD51C and XRCC3, binds D-loop structures through interaction with PALB2 and may be involved in the resolution of Holliday junctions (Chun et al. 2013, Park et al. 2014).<p>While RAD52 promotes formation of invasive RAD51 nucleofilaments in yeast, human BRCA2 performs this function, while human RAD52 regulates single strand annealing (SSA) (reviewed by Ciccia and Elledge 2010).''',
    5607585: '''In addition to the activation of canonical NF-kB subunits, activation of SYK pathway by Dectin-1 leads to the induction of the non-canonical NF-kB pathway, which mediates the nuclear translocation of RELB-p52 dimers through the successive activation of NF-kB-inducing kinase (NIK) and IkB kinase-alpha (IKKa) (Geijtenbeek & Gringhuis 2009, Gringhuis et al. 2009). Noncanonical activity tends to build more slowly and remain sustained several hours longer than does the activation of canonical NF-kB. The noncanonical NF-kB pathway is characterized by the post-translational processing of NFKB2 (Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B) p100 subunit to the mature p52 subunit. This subsequently leads to nuclear translocation of p52:RELB (Transcription factor RelB) complexes to induce cytokine expression of some genes (C-C motif chemokine 17 (CCL17) and CCL22) and transcriptional repression of others (IL12B) (Gringhuis et al. 2009, Geijtenbeek & Gringhuis 2009, Plato et al. 2013).

    5693605: '''Homology directed repair (HDR) of replication-independent DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) via homologous recombination repair (HRR) or single strand annealing (SSA) requires the activation of ATM followed by ATM-mediated phosphorylation of DNA repair proteins. ATM coordinates the recruitment of DNA repair and signaling proteins to DSBs and formation of the so-called ionizing radiation induced foci (IRIF). While IRIFs include chromatin regions kilobases away from the actual DSB, this Reactome pathway represents simplified foci and shows events that happen at the very ends of the broken DNA.<p>For both HRR and SSA to occur, the ends of the DNA DSB must be processed (resected) to generate lengthy 3' ssDNA tails, and the resulting ssDNA coated with RPA complexes, triggering ATR activation and signaling.<p>After the resection step, BRCA2 and RAD51 trigger HRR, a very accurate process in which the 3'-ssDNA overhang invades a sister chromatid, base pairs with the complementary strand of the sister chromatid DNA duplex, creating a D-loop, and uses the complementary sister chromatid strand as a template for DNA repair synthesis that bridges the DSB.<p>The SSA is triggered when 3'-ssDNA overhangs created in the resection step contain highly homologous direct repeats. In a process involving RAD52, the direct repeats in each 3'-ssDNA overhang become annealed, the unannealed 3'-flaps excised, and structures then processed by DNA repair synthesis. SSA results in the loss of one of the annealed repeats and the DNA sequence between the two repeats. Therefore, SSA is error-prone and is probably used as a backup for HRR, with RAD52 loss-of-function mutations being synthetically lethal with mutations in HRR genes, such as BRCA2 (reviewed by Ciccia and Elledge 2010).''',

This increase in calcium concentration induces calcineurin activation and consequently, dephosphorylation of NFAT and its translocation into the nucleus, triggering gene transcription and extracellular release of Interleukin-2 (Plato et al. 2013, Goodridge et al. 2007, Mourao-Sa et al. 2011).''',
    8982698: '''Glycogen, a highly branched glucose polymer, is formed and broken down in most human tissues, but is most abundant in liver and muscle, where it serves as a major stored fuel. Glycogen metabolism has been studied in most detail in liver and skeletal muscle. Glycogen metabolism in other tissues has not been studied as extensively, and is thought to resemble the muscle process.<br>Glycogen synthesis involves five reactions. The first two, conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to glucose 1-phosphate and synthesis of UDP-glucose from glucose 1-phosphate and UTP, are shared with several other pathways. The next three reactions, the auto-catalyzed synthesis of a glucose oligomer on glycogenin, the linear extension of the glucose oligomer catalyzed by glycogen synthase, and the formation of branches catalyzed by glycogen branching enzyme, are unique to glycogen synthesis. Repetition of the last two reactions generates large, extensively branched glycogen polymers. The catalysis of glycogenin glucosylation and oligoglucose chain extension by distinct isozymes in liver and nonhepatic tissues allows them to be regulated independently (Agius 2008; Bollen et al. 1998; Roach et al. 2012).<br>Cytosolic glycogen breakdown occurs via the same chemical steps in all tissues but is separately regulated via tissue specific isozymes and signaling pathways that enable distinct physiological fates for glycogen in liver and other tissues. Glycogen phosphorylase, which can be activated by phosphorylase kinase, catalyzes the removal of glucose residues as glucose 1-phosphate from the ends of glycogen branches. The final four residues of each branch are removed in two steps catalyzed by debranching enzyme, and further glycogen phosphorylase activity completes the process of glycogen breakdown. The first glucose residue in each branch is released as free glucose; all other residues are released as glucose 1-phosphate. The latter molecule can be converted to glucose 6-phosphate in a step shared with other pathways (Villar-Palasi & Larner 1970; Hers 1976).<br>Glycogen can also be taken up into lysosomes, where it is normally broken done by the action of a single enzyme, lysosomal alpha-glucosidase (GAA) (Brown et al. 1970).''',
    5693611: '''The nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway is initiated in response to the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by DNA-damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation. DNA DSBs are recognized by the MRN complex (MRE11A:RAD50:NBN), leading to ATM activation and ATM-dependent recruitment of a number of DNA damage checkpoint and repair proteins to DNA DSB sites (Lee and Paull 2005). The ATM phosphorylated MRN complex, MDC1 and H2AFX-containing nucleosomes (gamma-H2AX) serve as scaffolds for the formation of nuclear foci known as ionizing radiation induced foci (IRIF) (Gatei et al. 2000, Paull et al. 2000, Stewart et al. 2003, Stucki et al. 2005). Ultimately, both BRCA1:BARD1 heterodimers and TP53BP1 (53BP1) are recruited to IRIF (Wang et al. 2007, Pei et al. 2011, Mallette et al. 2012), which is necessary for ATM-mediated CHEK2 activation (Wang et al. 2002, Wilson et al. 2008). In G1 cells, TP53BP1 promotes NHEJ by recruiting RIF1 and PAX1IP, which displaces BRCA1:BARD1 and associated proteins from the DNA DSB site and prevents resection of DNA DSBs needed for homologous recombination repair (HRR) (Escribano-Diaz et al. 2013, Zimmermann et al. 2013, Callen et al. 2013). TP53BP1 also plays an important role in ATM-mediated phosphorylation of DCLRE1C (ARTEMIS) (Riballo et al. 2004, Wang et al. 2014). Ku70:Ku80 heterodimer (also known as the Ku complex or XRCC5:XRCC6) binds DNA DSB ends, competing away the MRN complex and preventing MRN-mediated resection of DNA DSB ends (Walker et al. 2001, Sun et al. 2012). The catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs, PRKDC) is then recruited to DNA-bound Ku to form the DNA-PK holoenzyme. Two DNA-PK complexes, one at each side of the break, bring DNA DSB ends together, joining them in a synaptic complex (Gottlieb 1993, Yoo and Dynan 2000). DNA-PK complex recruits DCLRE1C (ARTEMIS) to DNA DSB ends (Ma et al. 2002). PRKDC-mediated phosphorylation of DCLRE1C, as well as PRKDC autophosphorylation, enables DCLRE1C to trim 3'- and 5'-overhangs at DNA DSBs, preparing them for ligation (Ma et al. 2002, Ma et al. 2005, Niewolik et al. 2006). The binding of inositol phosphate may additionally stimulate the catalytic activity of PRKDC (Hanakahi et al. 2000). Other factors, such as polynucleotide kinase (PNK), TDP1 or TDP2 may remove unligatable damaged nucleotides from 5'- and 3'-ends of the DSB, converting them to ligatable substrates (Inamdar et al. 2002, Gomez-Herreros et al. 2013). DNA ligase 4 (LIG4) in complex with XRCC4 (XRCC4:LIG4) is recruited to ligatable DNA DSB ends together with the XLF (NHEJ1) homodimer and DNA polymerases mu (POLM) and/or lambda (POLL) (McElhinny et al. 2000, Hsu et al. 2002, Malu et al. 2002, Ahnesorg et al. 2006, Mahajan et al. 2002, Lee et al. 2004, Fan and Wu 2004). After POLL and/or POLM fill 1- or 2-nucleotide long single strand gaps at aligned DNA DSB ends, XRCC4:LIG4 performs the ligation of broken DNA strands, thus completing NHEJ. The presence of NHEJ1 homodimer facilitates the ligation step, especially at mismatched DSB ends (Tsai et al. 2007). Depending on other types of DNA damage present at DNA DSBs, NHEJ can result in error-free products, produce dsDNA with microdeletions and/or mismatched bases, or result in translocations (reviewed by Povrik et al. 2012).''',

    188591: '''The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is one member of the ERBB family of transmembrane glycoprotein tyrosine receptor kinases (RTK). Binding of EGFR to its ligands induces conformational change that unmasks the dimerization interface in the extracellular domain of EGFR, leading to receptor homo- or heterodimerization at the cell surface. Dimerization of the extracellular regions of EGFR triggers additional conformational change of the cytoplasmic EGFR regions, enabling the kinase domains of two EGFR molecules to achieve the catalytically active conformation. Ligand activated EGFR dimers trans-autophosphorylate on tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor. Phosphorylated tyrosines serve as binding sites for the recruitment of signal transducers and activators of intracellular substrates, which then stimulate intracellular signal transduction cascades that are involved in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Recruitment of complexes containing GRB2 and SOS1 to phosphorylated EGFR dimers either directly, through phosphotyrosine residues that serve as GRB2 docking sites, or indirectly, through SHC1 recruitment, promotes GDP to GTP exchange on RAS, resulting in the activation of RAF/MAP kinase cascade. Binding of complexes of GRB2 and GAB1 to phosphorylated EGFR dimers leads to formation of the active PI3K complex, conversion of PIP2 into PIP3, and activation of AKT signaling. Phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLCG1) can also be recruited directly, through EGFR phosphotyrosine residues that serve as PLCG1 docking sites, which leads to PLCG1 phosphorylation by EGFR and activation of DAG and IP3 signaling. EGFR signaling is downregulated by the action of ubiquitin ligase CBL. CBL binds directly to the phosphorylated EGFR dimer through the phosphotyrosine Y1045 in the C-tail of EGFR, and after CBL is phosphorylated by EGFR, it becomes active and ubiquitinates phosphorylated EGFR dimers, targeting them for degradation.

CLEC7A belongs to thetype-II C-type lectin receptor (CLR) family that can mediate its own intracellular signaling. Upon binding particulate beta-1,3-glucans, CLEC7A mediates intracellular signalling through its cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like motif (Brown 2006). CLEC7A signaling can induce the production of various cytokines and chemokines, including tumour-necrosis factor (TNF), CXC-chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2, also known as MIP2), interleukin-1beta (IL-1b), IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12 (Brown et al. 2003), it also triggers phagocytosis and stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus contributing to microbial killing (Gantner et al. 2003, Herre et al. 2004, Underhill et al. 2005, Goodridge at al. 2011, Reid et al. 2009).

While IRIFs include chromatin regions kilobases away from the actual DSB site, this Reactome pathway represents simplified foci and events that happen proximal to the DNA DSB ends.

H2AFX is phosphorylated on tyrosine 142 (Y142) under basal conditions (Xiao et al. 2009). After ATM-mediated phosphorylation of H2AFX on S139, tyrosine Y142 has to be dephosphorylated by EYA family phosphatases in order for the DNA repair to proceed and to avoid apoptosis induced by DNA DSBs (Cook et al. 2009). Gamma-H2AFX recruits MDC1 to DNA DSBs (Stucki et al. 2005). After ATM phosphorylates MDC1 (Liu et al. 2012), the MRN complex, gamma-H2AFX nucleosomes, and MDC1 serve as a core of the nuclear focus and a platform for the recruitment of other proteins involved in DNA damage signaling and repair (Lukas et al. 2004, Soutoglou and Misteli 2008).<p>RNF8 ubiquitin ligase binds phosphorylated MDC1 (Kolas et al. 2007) and, in cooperation with HERC2 and RNF168 (Bekker-Jensen et al. 2010, Campbell et al. 2012), ubiquitinates H2AFX (Mailand et al. 2007, Huen et al. 2007, Stewart et al. 2009, Doil et al. 2009) and histone demethylases KDM4A and KDM4B (Mallette et al. 2012).<p>Ubiquitinated gamma-H2AFX recruits UIMC1 (RAP80), promoting the assembly of the BRCA1-A complex at DNA DSBs.

    2855097: '''Ficolins are recognition molecules in the lectin pathway of complement activation. Three types of ficolin have been identified in humans: M-ficolin (ficolin-1, FCN1), L-ficolin (ficolin-2, FCN2) and H-ficolin (ficolin-3, FCN3). FCN2 and 3 circulate in blood plasma whereas FCN1 is locally secreted by immune response cells (Teh et al. 2000, Liu et al. 2005, Matsushita et al. 2002). Plasma ficolins circulate as complexes with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs). Upon binding of ficolins to carbohydrates on the target cell surface, MASPs are activated and subsequently activate the complement cascade (Matsushita et al. 2002, Gout et al. 2009). Ficolins function as trimers and larger oligomers. Ficolin peptide sequences contain an amino-terminal cysteine-rich region, a collagen-like domain, a neck region and a carboxy-terminal fibrinogen-like domain. The fibrinogen-like domain binds to pathogen- or apoptotic cell-associated molecular patterns. Different ficolins have distinct recognition specificities (Endo et al. 2007, Thiel and Gadjeva 2009, Garlatti et al. 2010). ''',

GAB1 acts as an adaptor protein that enables formation of an active PIK3, through recruitment of PIK3 regulatory subunit PIK3R1 (also known as PI3Kp85), which subsequently recruits PIK3 catalytic subunit PIK3CA (also known as PI3Kp110). PIK3, in complex with EGFR, GRB2 and GAB1, catalyzes phosphorylation of PIP2 and its conversion to PIP3, which leads to the activation of the AKT signaling. ''',
    8954043: '''E2F6, similar to other E2F proteins, possesses the DNA binding domain, the dimerization domain and the marked box. E2F6, however, does not have a pocket protein binding domain and thus does not interact with the retinoblastoma family members RB1, RBL1 (p107) and RBL2 (p130) (Gaubatz et al. 1998, Trimarchi et al. 1998, Cartwright et al. 1998). E2F6 lacks the transactivation domain and acts as a transcriptional repressor (Gaubatz et al. 1998, Trimarchi et al. 1998, Cartwright et al. 1998). E2F6 forms a heterodimer with TFDP1 (DP-1) (Trimarchi et al. 1998, Ogawa et al. 2002, Cartwright et al. 1998) or TFDP2 (DP-2) (Gaubatz et al. 1998, Trimarchi et al. 1998, Cartwright et al. 1998).<p>E2f6 knockout mice are viable and embryonic fibroblasts derived from these mice proliferate normally. Although E2f6 knockout mice appear healthy, they are affected by homeotic transformations of the axial skeleton, involving vertebrae and ribs. Similar skeletal defects have been reported in mice harboring mutations in polycomb genes, suggesting that E2F6 may function in recruitment of polycomb repressor complex(es) to target promoters (Storre et al. 2002).<p>E2F6 mediates repression of E2F responsive genes. While E2F6 was suggested to maintain G0 state in quiescent cells (Gaubatz et al. 1998, Ogawa et al. 2002), this finding has been challenged (Giangrande et al. 2004, Bertoli et al. 2013, Bertoli et al. 2016). Instead, E2F6-mediated gene repression in proliferating (non-quiescent) cells is thought to repress E2F targets involved in G1/S transition during S phase of the cell cycle. E2F6 does not affect E2F targets involved in G2/M transition (Oberley et al. 2003, Giangrande et al. 2004, Attwooll et al. 2005, Trojer et al. 2011, Bertoli et al. 2013). In the context of the E2F6.com-1 complex, E2F6 was shown to bind to promoters of E2F1, MYC, CDC25A and TK1 genes (Ogawa et al. 2002). E2F6 also binds the promoters of CDC6, RRM1 (RR1), PCNA and TYMS (TS) genes (Giangrande et al. 2004), as well as the promoter of the DHFR gene (Gaubatz et al. 1998). While transcriptional repression by the E2F6.com 1 complex may be associated with histone methyltransferase activity (Ogawa et al. 2002), E2F6 can also repress transcription independently of H3K9 methylation (Oberley et al. 2003).<p>During S phase, E2F6 is involved in the DNA replication stress checkpoint (Bertoli et al. 2013, Bertoli et al. 2016). Under replication stress, CHEK1-mediated phosphorylation prevents association of E2F6 with its target promoters, allowing transcription of E2F target genes whose expression is needed for resolution of stalled replication forks and restart of DNA synthesis. Inability to induce transcription of E2F target genes (due to CHEK1 inhibition or E2F6 overexpression) leads to replication stress induced DNA damage (Bertoli et al. 2013, Bertoli et al. 2016). E2F6 represses transcription of a number of E2F targets involved in DNA synthesis and repair, such as RRM2, RAD51, BRCA1, and RBBP8 (Oberley et al. 2003, Bertoli et al. 2013).''',

The adaptor protein GRB2 binds to phosphotyrosine residues in the C-tail of EGFR through its SH2 domain. GRB2 is constitutively associated with SOS, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor of RAS. GRB2 binding to phosphorylated EGFR results in the recruitment of SOS to the plasma membrane where it comes in proximity to RAS. This mechanism has been seen to be the model for RAS activation.''',
    5218485: '''The free radical nitric oxide (NO), produced by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), is an important vasoactive substance in normal vascular biology and pathophysiology. It plays an important role in vascular functions such as vascular dilation and angiogenesis (Murohara et al. 1998, Ziche at al. 1997). NO has been reported to be a downstream mediator in the angiogenic response mediated by VEGF, but the mechanism by which NO promotes neovessel formation is not clear (Babaei & Stewart 2002). Persistent vasodilation and increase in vascular permeability in the existing vasculature is observed during the early steps of angiogenesis, suggesting that  these hemodynamic changes are indispensable during an angiogenic processes. NO production by VEGF can occur either through the activation of PI3K or through a PLC-gamma dependent manner. Once activated both pathways converge on AKT phosphorylation of eNOS, releasing NO (Lin & Sessa 2006). VEGF also regulates vascular permeability by promoting VE-cadherin endocytosis at the cell surface through a VEGFR-2-Src-Vav2-Rac-PAK signalling axis.''',
    8941758: '''The transcription factor RUNX3 is a RUNX family member. All RUNX family members, RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3, possess a highly conserved Runt domain, involved in DNA binding. For a more detailed description of the structure of RUNX proteins, please refer to the pathway 'Transcriptional regulation by RUNX1'. Similar to RUNX1 and RUNX2, RUNX3 forms a transcriptionally active heterodimer with CBFB (CBF-beta). Studies in mice have shown that RUNX3 plays a role in neurogenesis and development of T lymphocytes. RUNX3 is implicated as a tumor suppressor gene in various human malignancies.<br>During nervous system formation, the Cbfb:Runx3 complex is involved in development of mouse proprioceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons by regulating expression of Ntrk3 (Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 3) and possibly other genes (Inoue et al. 2002, Kramer et al. 2006, Nakamura et al. 2008, Dykes et al. 2011, Ogihara et al. 2016). It is not yet known whether RUNX3 is involved in human neuronal development and neuronal disorders.<br>RUNX3 plays a major role in immune response. RUNX3 regulates development of T lymphocytes. In mouse hematopoietic stem cells, expression of Runx3 is regulated by the transcription factor TAL1 (Landry et al. 2008). RUNX3 promotes the CD8+ lineage fate in developing thymocytes. In the CD4+ thymocyte lineage in mice, the transcription factor ThPOK induces transcription of SOCS family members, which repress Runx3 expression (Luckey et al. 2014). RUNX3, along with RUNX1 and ETS1, is implicated in regulation of transcription of the CD6 gene, encoding a lymphocyte surface receptor expressed on developing and mature T cells (Arman et al. 2009). RUNX3 and ThPOK regulate intestinal CD4+ T cell immunity in a TGF-beta and retinoic acid-dependent manner, which is important for cellular defense against intestinal pathogens (Reis et al. 2013). Besides T lymphocytes, RUNX3 is a key transcription factor in the commitment of innate lymphoid cells ILC1 and ILC3 (Ebihara et al. 2015). RUNX3 regulates expression of CD11A and CD49D integrin genes, involved in immune and inflammatory responses (Dominguez-Soto et al. 2005). RUNX3 is involved in mouse TGF-beta-mediated dendritic cell function and its deficiency is linked to airway inflammation (Fainaru et al. 2004).<br>In addition to its developmental role, RUNX3 is implicated as a tumor suppressor. The loss of RUNX3 expression and function was first causally linked to the genesis and progression of human gastric cancer (Li et al. 2002). Expression of RUNX3 increases in human pancreatic islet of Langerhans cells but not in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells in response to differentiation stimulus (serum withdrawal) (Levkovitz et al. 2010). Hypermethylation of the RUNX3 gene is associated with an increased risk for progression of Barrett's esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma (Schulmann et al. 2005). Hypermethylation-mediated silencing of the RUNX3 gene expression is also frequent in granulosa cell tumors (Dhillon et al. 2004) and has also been reported in colon cancer (Weisenberger et al. 2006), breast cancer (Lau et al. 2006, Huang et al. 2012), bladder cancer (Wolff et al. 2008) and gastric cancer (Li et al. 2002). In colorectal cancer, RUNX3 is one of the five markers in a gene panel used to classify CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP+) (Weisenberger et al. 2006).<br>RUNX3 and CBFB are frequently downregulated in gastric cancer. RUNX3 cooperates with TGF-beta to maintain homeostasis in the stomach and is involved in TGF-beta-induced cell cycle arrest of stomach epithelial cells. Runx3 knockout mice exhibit decreased sensitivity to TGF-beta and develop gastric epithelial hyperplasia (Li et al. 2002, Chi et al. 2005). RUNX3-mediated inhibition of binding of TEADs:YAP1 complexes to target promoters is also implicated in gastric cancer suppression (Qiao et al. 2016).<br>RUNX3 is a negative regulator of NOTCH signaling and RUNX3-mediated inhibition of NOTCH activity may play a tumor suppressor role in hepatocellular carcinoma (Gao et al. 2010, Nishina et al. 2011).<br>In addition to RUNX3 silencing through promoter hypermethylation in breast cancer (Lau et al. 2006), Runx3+/- mice are predisposed to breast cancer development. RUNX3 downregulates estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) protein levels in a proteasome-dependent manner (Huang et al. 2012).<br>Besides its tumor suppressor role, mainly manifested through its negative effect on cell proliferation, RUNX3 can promote cancer cell invasion by stimulating expression of genes involved in metastasis, such as osteopontin (SPP1) (Whittle et al. 2015).''',

    9015502: '''Interleukin-33 (IL33) cytokine is a member of the Interleukin-1 family. It can be classified as an alarmin because it is released into the extracellular space during cell damage. It acts as an endogenous danger signal (Liew et al. 2010).]

The gene product is biologically active (full-length IL33). Its potency has been reported to increase significantly (up to 30x) after cleavage at the N-terminus by inflammatory proteases such as Cathepsin G (CTSG) and Neutrophil elastase (ELANE) (Lefrançais et al. 2012, Lefrançais et al. 2014) but others have suggested that processing inactivates IL33 (Cayrol & Girard 2009). IL33 can act as an extracellular ligand and an intracellular signaling molecule (Martin et al. 2013, 2016). Full-length IL33 has a nuclear localization sequence and can translocate to the nucleus, where it binds heterochromatin (Moussion et al. 2008, Carriere et al. 2007, Roussel et al. 2008, Kuchler et al. 2008, Sundlisaeter et al. 2012, Baekkevold et al. 2003). IL33 that has undergone proteolytic processing is unable to translocate to the nucleus (Martin et al. 2013, Ali et al. 2010).

Binding of extracellular IL33 to its receptor Interleukin-1 receptor-like 1 (IL1RL1, suppression of tumorigenicity 2, ST2) initiates several cellular signaling pathways. Cell injury or death are the dominant mechanisms by which IL33 reaches the extracellular environment, IL33 is not actively secreted by cells (Martin et al. 2016, Kaczmarek et al. 2013, Vancamelbeke et al. 2017). Because IL33 is expressed constitutively by endothelial and epithelial cells it is immediately available to the extracellular microenvironment after cell injury and necrosis (Lefrançais et al. 2012). Increases in extracellular ATP or mechanical stress correlate with increased IL33 secretion by mast cells or cardiomyocytes, respectively (Shimokawa et al. 2017, Kakkar et al. 2012, Zhao et al. 2012, Sanada et al. 2007, Chen et al. 2015). 

Soluble IL1RL1 (IL1RL1 Isoform C, ST2V) (Iwahana et al. 2005, Tominaga et al. 1999) shares the extracellular components of IL1RL1, including the ligand binding domain, but lacks the transmembrane and intracellular components of IL1RL1 (Kakkar et al. 2008, Iwahana et al. 1999). The IL33-IL1RL1 complex recruits a co-receptor, most commonly IL1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP, IL-1RAcP) (Schmitz et al. 2005, Lingel et al. 2009, Palmer et al. 2008, Liu et al. 2013).''',

    3928277: '''The interaction between ephrin (EFN) ligands and EPH receptors results not only in forward signaling through the EPH receptor, but also in 'reverse' signaling through the EFN ligand itself. Reverse signaling through EFNB is required for correct spine morphogenesis and proper path-finding of corpus callosum and dorsal retinal axons. The molecular mechanism by which EFNBs transduce a reverse signal involves phosphorylation of multiple, conserved tyrosines on the intracellular domain of B-type ephrins, facilitating binding of the SH2/SH3 domain adaptor protein GRB4 and subsequent cytoskeletal remodeling (Bruckner et al. 1997, Cowan & Henkemeyer 2001, Lu et al. 2001). The other mechanism of reverse signaling involves the C-terminus PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ)-binding motif of EFNBs which recruits various PDZ domain containing proteins. Phosphorylation and PDZ-dependent reverse signaling by ephrin-B1 have each been proposed to play important roles in multiple contexts in development and disease (Bush & Soriano 2009). ''',
    3928278: '''EPH/Ephrin signaling is coupled to Rho family GTPases such as Rac, Rho and Cdc42 that connect bidirectional receptor-ligand interactions to changes in the actin cytoskeleton (Noren & Pasquale 2004, Groeger & Nobes 2007). RHOA regulates actin dynamics and is involved in EPHA-induced growth cone collapse. This is mediated by ephexins. Ephexin, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho GTPases, interacts with the EPHA kinase domain and its subsequent activation differentially affects Rho GTPases, such that RHOA is activated, whereas Cdc42 and Rac1 are inhibited. Activation of RHOA, and inhibition of Cdc42 and Rac, shifts actin cytoskeleton to increased contraction and reduced expansion leading to growth-cone collapse (Shamah et al. 2001, Sahin et al. 2005). The activation of EPH receptors in growing neurons typically, but not always, leads to a growth cone collapse response and retraction from an ephrin-expressing substrate (Poliakov et al. 2004, Pasquale 2005). EPHA-mediated repulsive responses prevent axons from growing into regions of excessive ephrin-A concentration, such as the posterior end of the superior colliculus (Pasquale 2005).''',

    3322073: '''Glycogen, a highly branched glucose polymer, is formed and broken down in most human tissues, but is most abundant in liver and muscle, where it serves as a major stored fuel. Glycogen metabolism has been studied in most detail in muscle, although considerable experimental data are available concerning these reactions in liver as well. Glycogen metabolism in other tissues has not been studied as extensively, and is thought to resemble the muscle process. Glycogen synthesis involves five reactions. The first two, conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to glucose 1-phosphate and synthesis of UDP-glucose from glucose 1-phosphate and UTP, are shared with several other pathways. The next three reactions, the auto-catalyzed synthesis of a glucose oligomer on glycogenin, the linear extension of the glucose oligomer catalyzed by glycogen synthase, and the formation of branches catalyzed by glycogen branching enzyme, are unique to glycogen synthesis. Repetition of the last two reactions generates large, extensively branched glycogen polymers. The catalysis of glycogenin glucosylation and oligoglucose chain extension by distinct isozymes in liver and nonhepatic tissues allows them to be regulated independently (Agius 2008; Bollen et al. 1998; Roach et al. 2012).''',

Myristoyl-binding by the ARL3 effector UNC119B is required in an unknown fashion for the transport of the myristoylated cargo to the cilium. At the cilium, a GTPase cycle involving the ARF-like small GTPase ARL3 and its GAP protein RP2 promote the release of the myristoylated proteins into the ciliary membrane and the recycling and ciliary exit of UNC119B (Wright et al, 2011; reviewed in Schwarz et al, 2012).

The C-terminus of IRE1-alpha is located in the cytosol; the N-terminus is located in the ER lumen. In unstressed cells IRE1-alpha exists in an inactive heterodimeric complex with BiP such that BiP in the ER lumen binds the N-terminal region of IRE1-alpha. Upon accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, BiP binds the unfolded protein and the IRE1-alpha:BiP complex dissociates. The dissociated IRE1-alpha then forms homodimers. Initially the luminal N-terminal regions pair. This is followed by trans-autophosphorylation of IRE1-alpha at Ser724 in the cytosolic C-terminal region. The phosphorylation causes a conformational change that allows the dimer to bind ADP, causing a further conformational change to yield back-to-back pairing of the cytosolic C-terminal regions of IRE1-alpha. The fully paired IRE1-alpha homodimer has endoribonuclease activity and cleaves the mRNA encoding Xbp-1. A 26 residue polyribonucleotide is released and the 5' and 3' fragments of the original Xbp-1 mRNA are rejoined. The spliced Xbp-1 message encodes Xbp-1 (S), a potent activator of transcription. Xbp-1 (S) together with the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-Y bind the ER Stress Responsive Element (ERSE) in a number of genes encoding chaperones.

    3928286: '''During the development process cell migration and adhesion are the main forces involved in morphing the cells into critical anatomical structures. The ability of a cell to migrate to its correct destination depends heavily on signaling at the cell membrane. Erythropoietin producing hepatocellular carcinoma (EPH) receptors and their ligands, the ephrins (EPH receptors interacting proteins, EFNs), orchestrates the precise control necessary to guide a cell to its destination. They are expressed in all tissues of a developing embryo and are involved in multiple developmental processes such as axon guidance, cardiovascular and skeletal development and tissue patterning. In addition, EPH receptors and EFNs are expressed in developing and mature synapses in the nervous system, where they may have a role in regulating synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation. Activation of EPHB receptors in neurons induces the rapid formation and enlargement of dendritic spines, as well as rapid synapse maturation (Dalva et al. 2007). On the other hand, EPHA4 activation leads to dendritic spine elimination (Murai et al. 2003, Fu et al. 2007).<br>EPH receptors are the largest known family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), with fourteen total receptors divided into either A- or B-subclasses: EPHA (1-8 and 10) and EPHB (1-4 and 6). EPH receptors can have overlapping functions, and loss of one receptor can be partially compensated for by another EPH receptor that has similar expression pattern and ligand-binding specificities. EPH receptors have an N-terminal extracellular domain through which they bind to ephrin ligands, a short transmembrane domain, and an intracellular cytoplasmic signaling structure containing a canonical tyrosine kinase catalytic domain as well as other protein interaction sites. Ephrins are also sub-divided into an A-subclass (A1-A5), which are tethered to the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, and a B-subclass (B1-B3), members of which have a transmembrane domain and a short, highly conserved cytoplasmic tail lacking endogenous catalytic activity. The interaction between EPH receptors and its ligands requires cell-cell interaction since both molecules are membrane-bound. Close contact between EPH receptors and EFNs is required for signaling to occur. EPH/EFN-initiated signaling occurs bi-directionally into either EPH- or EFN-expressing cells or axons. Signaling into the EPH receptor-expressing cell is referred as the forward signal and signaling into the EFN-expressing cell, the reverse signal.

LIM-homeodomain transcription factors LHX2, LHX3, LHX4, LHX9 and ISL1 have so far been implicated in a cell type-dependent transcriptional regulation of ROBO1, ROBO2, ROBO3 and SLIT2 (Wilson et al. 2008, Marcos-Mondejar et al. 2012, Kim et al. 2016). Homeobox transcription factor HOXA2 is involved in transcriptional regulation of ROBO2 (Geisen et al. 2008). Transcription of SLIT1 during optic tract development in Xenopus is stimulated by FGF signaling and may also involve the transcription factor HOXA2, but the mechanism has not been established (Atkinson-Leadbeater et al. 2010). PAX6 and the homeodomain transcription factor NKX2.2 are also implicated in regulation of SLIT1 transcription (Genethliou et al. 2009). An RNA binding protein, MSI1, binds ROBO3 mRNA and promotes its translation, thus increasing ROBO3 protein levels (Kuwako et al. 2010). A poorly studied E3 ubiquitin ligase ZSWIM8 promotes degradation of ROBO3 (Wang et al. 2013). ROBO1 is protein half-life is increased via deubiquitination of ROBO1 by a ubiquitin protease USP33 (Yuasa-Kawada et al. 2009, Huang et al. 2015). Interaction of SLIT2 with DAG1 (dystroglycan) is important for proper localization of SLIT2 at the floor plate (Wright et al. 2012).

    73962: '''Double-strand breaks (DSBs), one of the most deleterious types of DNA damage along with interstrand crosslinks, are caused by ionizing radiation or certain chemicals such as bleomycin. DSBs also occur physiologically, during the processes of DNA replication, meiotic exchange, and V(D)J recombination.<p>DSBs are sensed (detected) by the MRN complex. Binding of the MRN complex to the DSBs usually triggers ATM kinase activation, thus initiating the DNA double strand break response. ATM phosphorylates a number of proteins involved in DNA damage checkpoint signaling, as well as proteins directly involved in the repair of DNA DSBs. DSBs are repaired via homology directed repair (HDR) or via nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ).<p>HDR requires resection of DNA DSB ends. Resection creates 3'-ssDNA overhangs which then anneal with a homologous DNA sequence. This homologous sequence can then be used as a template for DNA repair synthesis that bridges the DSB. HDR preferably occurs through the error-free homologous recombination repair (HRR), but can also occur through the error-prone single strand annealing (SSA), or the least accurate microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). MMEJ takes place when DSB response cannot be initiated.<p>While HRR is limited to actively dividing cells with replicated DNA, error-prone NHEJ pathway functions at all stages of the cell cycle, playing the predominant role in both the G1 phase and in S-phase regions of DNA that have not yet replicated. During NHEJ, the Ku70:Ku80 heterodimer (also known as the Ku complex or XRCC5:XRCC6) binds DNA DSB ends, competing away the MRN complex and preventing MRN-mediated resection of DNA DSB ends. The catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs, PRKDC) is then recruited to DNA-bound Ku to form the DNA-PK holoenzyme. Two DNA-PK complexes, one at each side of the break, bring DNA DSB ends together, joining them in a synaptic complex. DNA-PK complex recruits DCLRE1C (ARTEMIS) to DNA DSB ends, leading to trimming of 3'- and 5'-overhangs at the break site, followed by ligation. <p>For review of this topic, please refer to Ciccia and Elledge 2010.

    3928298: '''Despite high-affinity multimeric interaction between EPHs and ephrins (EFNs), the cellular response to EPH-EFN engagement is usually repulsion between the two cells and signal termination. These repulsive responses induce an EPH receptor-expressing cell to retract from an ephrin-expressing cell after establishing initial contact. The repulsive responses mediated by EPH receptors in the growth cone at the leading edge of extending axons and in axonal collateral branches contribute to the formation of selective neuronal connections. It is unclear how high affinity trans-cellular interactions between EPHs and ephrins are broken to convert adhesion into repulsion. Two possible mechanisms have been proposed for the repulsion of EPH-EFN bearing cells: the first one involves regulated cleavage of ephrin ligands or EPH receptors by transmembrane proteases following cell-cell contact, while the second one is rapid endocytosis of whole EPH:EFN complexes during the retraction of the interacting cells or neuronal growth cones (Egea & Klein 2007, Janes et al. 2005). RAC also plays an essential role during growth cone collapse by promoting actin polymerization that drives membrane internalization by endocytosis (Marston et al. 2003).''',

Transcription of miR-132 is regulated by BDNF signaling, through an unknown mechanism (Klein et al. 2007, Su et al. 2015).<p>Binding of MECP2 to other proteins and to DNA is regulated by posttranslational modifications, of which phosphorylation has been best studied. Calcium dependent protein kinases, PKA and CaMK IV, activated by neuronal membrane depolarization, phosphorylate MECP2 at threonine residue T308 (corresponding to T320 in the longer MECP2 splicing isoform, MECP2_e1). Phosphorylation at T308 correlates with neuronal activity and inhibits binding of MECP2 to the nuclear receptor co-repressor complex (NCoR/SMRT) (Ebert et al. 2013). In resting neurons, MECP2 is phosphorylated at serine residue S80, which results in a decreased association of MECP2 with chromatin. Nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase HIPK2 phosphorylates MECP2 on serine residue S80 (Bracaglia et al. 2009). In activity-induced neurons, upon neuronal membrane depolarization, MECP2 S80 becomes dephosphorylated, and MECP2 acquires phosphorylation on serine S423 (corresponding to mouse Mecp2 serine S421). CaMK IV is one of the kinases that can phosphorylate MECP2 on S423. Phosphorylation of MECP2 at S423 increases MECP2 binding to chromatin (Zhou et al. 2006, Tao et al. 2009, Qiu et al. 2012). AURKB phosphorylates MECP2 at serine residue S423 in dividing adult neuronal progenitor cells (Li et al. 2014).<p>Besides binding to the NCoR/SMRT co-repressor complex (Lyst et al. 2013, Ebert et al. 2013), MECP2 binds the SIN3A co-repressor complex. This interaction involves the transcriptional repressor domain of MECP2 and the amino terminal part of the HDAC interaction domain (HID) of SIN3A. HDAC1 and HDAC2 are part of the SIN3A co-repressor complex that co-immunoprecipitates with MECP2 (Nan et al. 1998). While binding of MECP2 to SIN3A at target genes is associated with transcriptional repression, binding to CREB1 at target genes is associated with transcriptional activation (Chahrour et al. 2008, Chen et al. 2013). Function of MECP2 can be affected by binding to FOXG1, another gene mutated in Rett syndrome besides MECP2 and CDKL5 (Dastidar et al. 2012), and HTT (Huntingtin) (McFarland et al. 2013).

    73968: '''Of the three major pathways involved in the repair of nucleotide damage in DNA, base excision repair (BER) involves the greatest number of individual enzymatic activities. This is the consequence of the numerous individual glycosylases, each of which recognizes and removes a specific modified base(s) from DNA. BER is responsible for the repair of the most prevalent types of DNA lesions, oxidatively damaged DNA bases, which arise as a consequence of reactive oxygen species generated by normal mitochondrial metabolism or by oxidative free radicals resulting from ionizing radiation, lipid peroxidation or activated phagocytic cells. BER is a two-step process initiated by one of the DNA glycosylases that recognizes a specific modified base(s) and removes that base through the catalytic cleavage of the glycosydic bond, leaving an abasic site without disruption of the phosphate-sugar DNA backbone. Subsequently, abasic sites are resolved by a series of enzymes that cleave the backbone, insert the replacement residue(s), and ligate the DNA strand. BER may occur by either a single-nucleotide replacement pathway or a multiple-nucleotide patch replacement pathway, depending on the structure of the terminal sugar phosphate residue. The glycosylases found in human cells recognize "foreign adducts" and not standard functional modifications such as DNA methylation (Lindahl and Wood 1999, Sokhansanj et al. 2002).''',

Substrates of the Cdc20:APC/C complex, which are recognized by a  motif known as the destruction box (D box)  include Cyclin A, Nek2, Securin and Cyclin B. Degradation of Securin and Cyclin B does not occur until the mitotic spindle checkpoint has been satisfied (see Castro et al. 2005).<br>Cdc20 is degraded  late in mitosis (Reviewed in Owens and Hoyt, 2005).  At this time the activating subunit, Cdh1, previously maintained in an inactive phosphorylated state by mitotic kinases, is dephosphorylated and associates with and activates the APC/C.  The APC/C:Cdh1 complex recognizes substrates containing  a D box, a KEN box  (Pfleger and Kirschner, 2000) or a D box activated  (DAD) domain (Castro et al., 2002) sequence and promotes the ordered  degration of mitotic cyclins and other mitotic proteins culminating with its own  ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) subunit UbcH10 (Rape et al., 2006). This ordered degradation promotes the stability of Cyclin A at the end of G1. This stabilization, in turn, promotes the phosphorylation of Cdh1 and its abrupt dissociation from the APC/C, allowing accumulation of cyclins for the next G1/S transition (Sorensen et al., 2001).  <br><br>''',

Processive substrates acquire a polyubiquitin chain upon binding to the APC/C once and are degraded. Distributive substrates bind, dissociate and reassociate with the APC/C multiple times before acquiring an ubiquitin chain of sufficient length to insure degradation. In addition, distributive substrates that dissociate from the APC/C with short ubiquitin chains are targeted for deubiquitination (Rape et al., 2006).''',

    8941875: '''RUNX3, like other RUNX family members, is transcribed from two promoters - the proximal P2 promoter and the distal P1 promoter. The P2 promoter is positioned within a large CpG island that is frequently methylated in solid tumors, resulting in epigenetic inactivation of the RUNX3 gene (reviewed by Levanon and Groner 2004). RUNX3 transcription is affected by SMAD4 levels. RUNX3 may directly upregulate its own transcription through a positive feedback loop (Whittle et al. 2015). Under hypoxic conditions, RUNX3 transcription is downregulated. Hypoxic silencing of RUNX3 involves hypoxia-induced upregulation of the histone methyltransferase G9a and histone deacetylase HDAC1, which leads to increased dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine residue K9 (K10 when taking into account the initiator methionine) and reduced acetylation of histone H3 at the RUNX3 promoter (Lee et al. 2009).<br>RUNX3 protein levels are inversely related to the levels of microRNA miR-130b.

    9007422: '''Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that bind to small lipid based molecules to regulate gene expression and other cellular process. This family includes receptors for steroid hormones and derivatives (such as estrogen, progesterone,  glucocorticoids, Vitamin D, oxysterols and bile acids, among others) as well as receptors for retinoic acids, thyroid hormones and fatty acids and their derivatives. These ligands are able to diffuse directly through cellular membranes as a result of their lipophilic nature (reviewed in Beato et al, 1996; Holzer et al, 2017). 

The 48 human nuclear receptors share a conserved modular structure that consists of a sequence specific DNA-binding domain and a ligand-binding domain, in addition to various other protein-protein interaction domains. Upon interaction with ligand, NRs bind to the regulatory regions of target genes as homo- or heterodimers, or more rarely, as monomers.  At the promoter, NRs interact with other activators and repressors to regulate gene expression (reviewed Beato et al, 1996; Simons et al, 2014; Hah and Kraus, 2010).

A number of nuclear receptors are cytoplasmic in the absence of ligand and exist as part of a heat shock protein complex that regulates their cellular location, protein stability, competency to bind steroid hormones and transcriptional activity (Echeverria and Picard, 2010). Ligand-binding to these receptors promotes dimerization and nuclear translocation.  Other nuclear receptors are contstitutively nuclear and their chromatin-modifying activities are regulated by ligand binding (reviewed in Beato et al, 1996). 

In addition to the classic transcriptional response, NRs also have a role in rapid, non-nuclear signaling originating from receptors localized at the plasma membrane. Ligand-binding to these receptors intitiates downstream phospholipase- and kinase-based signaling cascades (reviewed in Schwartz et al, 2016; Levin and Hammes, 2016).

During this process the preadipocytes cease to proliferate, begin to accumulate lipid droplets and develop morphologic and biochemical characteristics of mature adipocytes such as hormone responsive lipogenenic and lipolytic programs. The most intensively studied model system for adipogenesis is differentiation of the mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line by an induction cocktail of containing mitogens (insulin/IGF1), glucocorticoid (dexamethasone), an inducer of cAMP (IBMX), and fetal serum (Cao et al. 1991, reviewed in Farmer 2006).

However, it is the subsequent inductions of CEBPA and PPARG that are critical for morphological, biochemical and functional adipocytes.<br>Ectopic expression of CEBPB alone is capable of inducing substantial adipocyte differentiation in fibroblasts while CEBPD has a minimal effect. CEBPB is upregulated in response to intracellular cAMP (possibly via pCREB) and serum mitogens (possibly via Krox20). CEBPD is upregulated in response to glucocorticoids. The exact mechanisms that upregulate the CEBPs are not fully known.<br>CEBPB and CEBPD act directly on the Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor Gamma (PPARG) gene by binding its promoter and activating transcription. CEBPB and CEBPD also directly activate the EBF1 gene (and possibly other EBFs) and KLF5 (Jimenez et al. 2007, Oishi 2005). The EBF1 and KLF5 proteins, in turn bind, and activate the PPARG promoter. Other hormones, such as insulin, affect PPARG expression and other transcription factors, such as ADD1/SREBP1c, bind the PPARG promoter. This is an area of ongoing research.<br>During adipogenesis the PPARG gene is transcribed to yield 2 variants. The adipogenic variant 2 mRNA encodes 30 additional amino acids at the N-terminus compared to the widely expressed variant 1 mRNA.<br>PPARG encodes a type II nuclear hormone receptor (remains in the nucleus in the absence of ligand) that forms a heterodimer with the Retinoid X Receptor Alpha (RXRA). The heterodimer was initially identified as a complex regulating the aP2/FABP4 gene and named ARF6 (Tontonoz et al. 1994).<br>The PPARG:RXRA heterodimer binds a recognition sequence that consists of two hexanucleotide motifs (DR1 motifs) separated by 1 nucleotide. Binding occurs even in the absence of ligands, such as fatty acids, that activate PPARG. In the absence of activating ligands, the PPARG:RXRA complex recruits repressors of transcription such as SMRT/NCoR2, NCoR1, and HDAC3 (Tontonoz and Spiegelman 2008).<br>Each molecule of PPARG can bind 2 molecules of activating ligands. Although, the identity of the endogenous ligands of PPARG is unknown, exogenous activators include fatty acids and the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs (reviewed in Berger et al. 2005, Heikkinen et al. 2007, Lemberger et al. 1996). The most potent activators of PPARG in vitro are oxidized derivatives of unsaturated fatty acids.. Upon binding activating ligands PPARG causes a rearrangement of adjacent factors: Corepressors such as SMRT/NCoR2 are lost and coactivators such as TIF2, PRIP, CBP, and p300 are recruited (Tontonoz and Spiegelman). PPARG also binds directly to the TRAP220 subunit of the TRAP/Mediator complex that recruits RNA polymerase II. Thus binding of activating ligand by PPARG causes transcription of PPARG target genes.<br>Targets of PPARG include genes involved in differentiation (PGAR/HFARP, Perilipin, aP2/FABP4, CEBPA), fatty acid transport (LPL, FAT/CD36), carbohydrate metabolism (PEPCK-C, AQP7, GK, GLUT4 (SLC2A4)), and energy homeostasis (LEPTIN and ADIPONECTIN) (Perera et al. 2006).<br>Within 10 days of differentiation CEBPB and CEBPD are no longer located at the PPARG promoter. Instead CEBPA is present. EBF1 and PPARG bind the CEBPA promoter and activate transcription of CEBPA, one of the key transcription factors in adipogenesis. A current hypothesis posits a self-reinforcing loop that maintains PPARG expression and the differentiated state: PPARG activates CEBPA and CEBPA activates PPARG. Additionally EBF1 (and possibly other EBFs) activates CEBPA, CEBPA activates EBF1, and EBF1 activates PPARG.''',

    8876382: '''Listeria monocytogenes is a short, gram-positive, nonspore-forming motile rod. Serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b and 4b make up more than 95% of isolates from humans, with serotype 4b causing most of the food-borne outbreaks. Listeria monocytogenes enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract after ingestion of contaminated food. The bacteria can survive food preservation procedures, such as refrigeration, low pH and high salt.<br>Listeria monocytogenes expresses several adhesin proteins at the cell surface that facilitate bacterial binding and entry to host cells. The bacteria can enter host cells through endocytosis mediated by binding of the bacterial InlA (internalin) protein to CDH1 (E-cadherin) at the host cell plasma membrane. Listeria monocytogenes can also enter host cells through endocytosis mediated by binding of the bacterial InlB protein to MET receptor tyrosine kinase at the host cell plasma membrane. Listeria monocytogenes proliferates inside the host cells and triggers formation of filopods, elongated protrusions of the host plasma membrane that contain bacteria. Filopods are ingested by adjacent cells, allowing Listeria monocytogenes to spread from cell to cell, invisible to the immune system of the host.<br>Listeria monocytogenes can cross the intestinal, blood-brain and placental barriers. In immunocompetent adults Listeria monocytogenes infection usually causes gastroenteritis. In infants infected in utero and in immunocompromised adults Listeria monocytogenes infection can result in meningoencephalitis and bacteremia (sepsis).<br>InlA is critical for crossing the intestinal barrier while both InlA and InlB are needed for crossing the placental barrier (Gessain et al. 2015) and, based on in vitro studies, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (Grundler et al. 2013). It seems that the intrinsic level of PI3K activity in Listeria-targeted host cells determines whether the entry depends on InlA only or InlA and InlB. The interaction of InlA with E-cadherin does not activate PI3K/AKT signaling while the interaction of InlB with the MET receptor activated the PI3K/AKT signal transduction cascade. Therefore, InlB-MET interaction may be important in tissues with low intrinsic PI3K activity (Gessain et al. 2015). Even if InlA-E-cadherin route is sufficient for bacterial entry, InlB may accelerate bacterial invasion (Pentecost et al. 2010). Cholesterol levels in host cell plasma membrane may also influence the preferred route for bacterial endocytosis (Seveau et al. 2004). In addition to InlA and InlB, many other virulence factors are involved in the Listeria monocytogenes infection cycle (Camejo et al. 2011) and will be annotated as mechanistic details become available.<br>For review, please refer to Bonazzi et al. 2009, Brooks et al. 2010, Camejo et al. 2011, Pizarro-Cerda et al. 2012.''',

    9605476: '''MUTYH gene is located on chromosome 1 and encodes a DNA glycosylase involved in base excision repair (BER). MUTYH (MYH) functions as an adenine DNA glycosylase and removes adenines and 2-hydroxyadenines on the newly synthesized DNA strand mispaired with guanines or 8-oxoguanines. 8-oxogunanines are produced by oxidation of guanines in DNA or by incorporation of 8-oxodGTP from the nucleotide pool into the newly synthesized DNA strand. Germline mutations in MUTYH cause the MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), a syndrome that resembles the familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) syndrome, caused by mutations in the APC tumor suppressor gene. MAP is also known as the familial adenomatous polyposis 2 (FAP2) (OMIM:608456). MAP-affected individuals are predisposed to development of multiple colorectal adenomas and colorectal cancer. MAP is largely inherited in an autosomally recessive manner, with both MUTYH alleles affected. The predisposition of heterozygous MUTYH mutation carriers to MAP has not been completely ruled out (Fleischmann et al. 2004).<br><br>MUTYH is most frequently affected by missense mutations in MAP patients, with two major mutations, Y165C and G382D, reported in about 80% of MAP patients of European origin. In Japanese patients, the most frequently reported mutation was Q324H (Yanaru-Fujisawa et al. 2008). Residues Y165C and G382D in the abundant MUTYH isoform MUTYH alpha-3 (MUTYH-3), used in the majority of functional studies, correspond to Y176C and G393D, respectively, in the canonical UniProt isoform (MUTYH alpha-1) and to Y179C and G396, respectively, in the longest NCBI isoform, which is used as a reference isoform in the database InSiGHT (International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours Database). However, both the canonical UniProt and NCBI MUTYH isoforms are expressed at very low levels or not at all (Plotz et al. 2012). In addition to the isoform MUTYH alpha-3, the other two abundant MUTYH isoforms are MUTYH beta-3 and MUTYH gamma-3 (Plotz et al. 2012), which differ from MUTYH alpha-3 in the first exon used. Exons 1-alpha and 1-beta contain sequences that resemble a mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS). It was reported that MUTYH alpha-3 and MUTYH beta-3 predominantly localize to mitochondria, while MUTYH gamma-3 predominantly localizes to the nucleus (Takao et al. 1999). However, a nuclear localization signal is located at the C-terminus of all MUTYH isoforms and other studies suggested that all isoforms can localize to the nucleus and only a small fraction of MUTYH is targeted to the mitochondria (Ohtsubo et al. 2000, Ichinoe et al. 2004). A small number of functional studies of MUTYH mutants uses the MUTYH isoform gama-3 (Goto et al. 2010, Shinmura et al. 2012). Nuclear localization of MUTYH may be affected by a splicing site variant (Tao et al. 2004).<br><br>MAP, compared with APC-associated FAP, is characterized by a later age of onset and a smaller number and size of polyps. Germline MUTYH mutations are associated with an increased incidence of duodenal polyps, gastric cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, dental and dermoid cysts, and osteomas. MUTYH mutations are rarely reported in the sporadic colorectal cancer. Tumors that develop in MAP patients are characterized with an excess of G:C -> T:A transversions in tumor suppressor genes, such as APC, and oncogenes, such as KRAS, which is a consequence of MUTYH functional impairment.<br><br>A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the splice donor site was reported to affect translation efficiency of MUTYH transcript, but its relevance for cancer predisposition has not been clarified (Yamaguchi et al. 2002). Catalytic activity of MUTYH and its mutants may be affected by posttranslational modifications (Parker et al. 2003, Kundu et al. 2010).

    164215: '''Many hormones that affect individual physiological processes including the regulation of appetite, absorption, transport, and oxidation of foodstuffs influence energy metabolism pathways. While <b>insulin</b> mediates the storage of excess nutrients, <b>glucagon</b> is involved in the mobilization of energy resources in response to low blood glucose levels, principally by stimulating hepatic glucose output. Small doses of glucagon are sufficient to induce significant glucose elevations. These hormone-driven regulatory pathways enable the body to sense and respond to changed amounts of nutrients in the blood and demands for energy.<br>Glucagon and Insulin act through various metabolites and enzymes that target specific steps in metabolic pathways for sugar and fatty acids. The processes responsible for the long-term control of fat synthesis and short term control of glycolysis by key metabolic products and enzymes are annotated in this module as six specific pathways:<br><b>Pathway 1. Glucagon signalling in metabolic pathways:</b> In response to low blood glucose, pancreatic alpha-cells release glucagon. The binding of glucagon to its receptor results in increased cAMP synthesis, and Protein Kinase A (PKA) activation.<br><b>Pathway 2. PKA mediated phosphorylation:</b>PKA phosphorylates key enzymes, e.g., 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase /Fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PF2K-Pase) at serine 36, and regulatory proteins, e.g., Carbohydrate Response Element Binding Protein (ChREBP) at serine 196 and threonine 666.<br>In brief, the binding of insulin to its receptor leads to increased protein phosphatase activity and to hydrolysis of cAMP by cAMP phosphodiesterase. These events counteract the regulatory effects of glucagon.<br><b>Pathway 3: Insulin stimulates increased synthesis of Xylulose-5-phosphate (Xy-5-P)</b>. Activation of the insulin receptor results indirectly in increased Xy-5-P synthesis from Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and Fructose-6-phosphate.

In recent years, a number of cis- and trans-acting elements have been identified that regulate the alternative splicing event. Exon IIIb repression is mediated by the presence of weak splice sites flanking the exon, an exonic silencing sequence (ESS) within the IIIb exon and both intronic silencing sequences (ISS) upstream and downstream (Carstens et al, 2000; Del Gatto and Breathnach, 1995; Del Gatto et al, 1996; Wagner et al 2005; Wagner and Garcia-Blanco, 2001).

    4641167: '''In the absence of a WNT signal, many WNT target genes are repressed by Groucho/TLE.  Groucho was initially identified in Drosophila, where it has been shown to interact with a variety of proteins to repress transcription (reviewed in Turki-Judeh and Courey, 2012).  Groucho proteins, including the 4 human homologues (transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE) 1-4), do not bind DNA directly but instead are recruited to target genes through interaction with DNA-binding transcription factors including TCF/LEF (Brantjes et al, 2001; reviewed in Chen and Courey, 2000). Groucho proteins are believed to oligomerize in a manner that depends on an N-terminal glutamine-rich Q domain, and oligomerization may be important for function (Song et al, 2004; Pinto and Lobe, 1996).  Groucho/TLE proteins affect levels of gene expression by interacting with the core transcriptional machinery as well as by modfiying chromatin structure through direct interaction with histones and recruitment of histone deacetylases, among other mechanisms (reviewed in Turki-Judeh and Courey, 2012).  In addition to the four TLE proteins, human cells also include a truncated TLE-like protein called amino-terminal enhancer of split (AES) which contains the N-terminal Q domain but lacks much of the C-terminal sequence of TLE proteins, including the WD domain which is important for many protein-protein interactions.  AES is believed to act as a dominant negative, since it is able to heter-oligomerize with full-length TLE proteins to form non-functional complexes (Brantjes et al, 2001; reviewed in Beagle and Johnson, 2010).''',
    192911: '''Spliced and unspliced viral mRNA in the cytoplasm are translated by host cell ribosomal translation machinery (reviewed in Kash, 2006).  At least ten viral proteins are synthesized:  HA, NA, PB1, PB2, PA, NP, NS1, NEP/NS2, M1, and M2.  Viral mRNA translation is believed to be enhanced by conserved 5'UTR sequences that interact with the ribosomal machinery and at least one cellular RNA-binding protein, G-rich sequence factor 1 (GRSF-1), has been found to specifically interact with the viral 5' UTRs.  (Park, 1995; Park, 1999).  The viral NS1 protein and the cellular protein P58(IPK) enhance viral translation indirectly by preventing the activation of the translational inhibitor PKR (Salvatore, 2002;  Goodman, 2006).  The viral NS1 protein has also been proposed to specifically enhance translation through interaction with host poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) (Burgui, 2003).  Simultaneously, host cell protein synthesis is downregulated in influenza virus infection through still uncharacterized mechanisms (Katze, 1986; Garfinkel, 1992; Kash, 2006).

NOTCH3, through pre-TCR signaling, stimulates expression of the RNA binding protein HuD, which promotes splicing of IKZF1 into dominant negative isoforms. These dominant negative isoforms of IKZF1 heterodimerize with IK1, preventing its binding to target DNA sequences and thus contributing to sustained transcription of PTCRA (Bellavia et al. 2007, reviewed by Bellavia, Mecarrozzi, Campese, Grazioli, Gulino and Screpanti 2007).<p><p>NOTCH3-triggered pre-TCR-signaling downregulates the activity of the transcription factor TCF3 (E2A), through ERK-dependent induction of ID1.

    5632436: '''Repression of Hh signaling in the absence of ligand depends on the transmembrane receptor protein Patched (PTCH), which inhibits Smoothened (SMO) activity by an unknown mechanism. This promotes the proteolytic processing and/or degradation of the GLI family of transcription factors and maintains the pathway in a transcriptionally repressed state (reviewed in Briscoe and Therond, 2013). In the absence of ligand, PTCH is localized in the cilium, while SMO is largely concentrated in intracellular compartments.  Upon binding of Hh to the PTCH receptor, PTCH is endocytosed, relieving SMO inhibition and allowing it to accumulate in the primary cilium (Marigo et al, 1996; Chen and Struhl, 1996; Stone et al, 1996; Rohatgi et al, 2007; Corbit et al, 2005; reviewed in Goetz and Anderson, 2010).

Despite the evolutionary conservation, the mode of ligand binding by CDON/Ihog and BOC/Boi is distinct in vertebrates and invertebrates.  High affinity ligand-binding by CDON and BOC requires Ca2+, while invertebrate ligand-binding is heparin-dependent (Okada et al, 2006; Tenzen et al, 2006; McLellan et al, 2008; Yao et al, 2006; Kavran et al, 2010). GAS1 is a vertebrate-specific GPI-anchored protein that similarly binds both to Hh ligand and to the PTCH receptor to promote Hh signaling (Martinelli and Fan, 2007; Izzi et al, 2011; reviewed in Kang et al, 2007).  CDON, BOC and GAS1 have partially overlapping but not totally redundant roles, and knock-out of all three is required to abrogate Hh signaling in mice (Allen et al, 2011; Izzi et al, 2011; reviewed in Briscoe and Therond, 2013).

ERBB4 m80 undergoes further proteolytic cleavage, mediated by the gamma-secretase complex, which releases the soluble 80 kDa ERBB4 intracellular domain, known as ERBB4 s80 or E4ICD, into the cytosol (Ni et al. 2001). ERBB4 s80 is able to translocate to the nucleus, promote nuclear translocation of various transcription factors, and act as a transcription co-factor.

The tumor suppressor WWOX, another WW-domain containing protein, competes with YAP1 in binding to ERBB4 s80 and prevents translocation of ERBB4 s80 to the nucleus (Aqeilan et al. 2005). ERBB4 s80 is also able to translocate to the mitochondrial matrix, presumably when its nuclear translocation is inhibited.

The interaction of WWP1 and ITCH with intact ERBB4 is independent of receptor activation and autophosphorylation. Binding of WWP1 and ITCH ubiquitin ligases leads to ubiquitination of ERBB4 and its cleavage products, and subsequent degradation through both proteasomal and lysosomal routes (Omerovic et al. 2007, Feng et al. 2009). In addition, the s80 cleavage product of ERBB4 JM-A CYT-1 isoform is the target of NEDD4 ubiquitin ligase. NEDD4 binds ERBB4 JM-A CYT-1 s80 (ERBB4jmAcyt1s80) through its PIK3R1 interaction site and mediates ERBB4jmAcyt1s80 ubiquitination, thereby decreasing the amount of ERBB4jmAcyt1s80 that reaches the nucleus (Zeng et al. 2009).''',
    5251516: '''APC is a large and central component of the destruction complex, which limits signaling in the absence of WNT ligand by promoting the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of beta-catenin.  APC interacts with numerous components of the destruction complex, including AXINs (AXIN1 and AXIN2), GSK3s (GSK3alpha and GSK3beta), CK1, PP2A and beta-catenin, and these interactions are critical for the phosphorylation and degradation of beta-catenin (reviewed in Saito-Diaz et al, 2013).  APC is itself the target of phosphorylation and K63 ubiquitination in the absence of WNT signaling and these modifications are required for its interactions with other components of the destruction complex (Tran and Polakis, 2012; Ha et al, 2004; reviewed in Stamos and Weis, 2013).<br><br>More than 85% of sporadic and hereditary colorectal tumors carry loss-of-function mutations in APC.  Most of the mutations are frameshifts and result in truncated proteins that lack the SAMP motifs and the 15 and 20 aa repeats that are implicated in binding AXIN and regulating beta-catenin binding and degradation (Miyoshi et al, 1992; Nagase and Nakamura, 1993; reviewed in Segditas and Tomlinson, 2006).  Cancers expressing truncated APC have high levels of cytoplasmic beta-catenin and deregulated expression of WNT target genes (Korinek et al, 1997).  Approximately 15% of the colorectal tumors with wild-type APC harbor phosphodegron mutations of beta-catenin; interestingly, mutations in APC and beta-catenin are mutually exclusive events.  Similar to APC-mutant tumors, beta-catenin is stabilized in these tumors and constitutive WNT target activation is detected  (Morin et al, 1997; reviewed in Polakis, 2000).<br><br>''',
    5251519: '''AXIN1 and AXIN2 are critical scaffolding proteins of the beta-catenin destruction complex and make protein-protein interactions with several of the other complex components including APC, GSK3, CK1 and beta-catenin itself through specific domains (reviewed in Saito-Diaz et al, 2013). Because of its role in promoting the degradation of beta-catenin and thereby restricting WNT signaling, AXIN1 is regarded as a tumor suppressor; consistent with this, biallelic mutations in AXIN1 that abrogate its expression or result in the production of truncated proteins have been identified in some human cancers, notably in hepatocellular and  colorectal carcinomas and medullobalstoma (Satoh et al, 2000; Taniguchi et al, 2002; Shimizu et al, 2002; Dahmen et al, 2001; reviewed in Salahshor and Woodgett, 2005).''',
    418241: '''Chicken and human telomeres share many features including the sequence of telomeric repeats [(TTAGGG)n], the structure and function of telomerase and its components, differential telomerase activity profiles among cell types, age-related and division-dependent telomere shortening, the complement of binding proteins associated with the telomere and the role of telomerase in immortalization and cellular transformation.<p>Three to five percent of the chicken genome is telomeric DNA including both terminal and interstitial telomeric repeats, which is ten times that found in the human genome (Delany et al. 2000; Nanda et al. 2002; O'Hare and Delany 2009). The quantity of telomeric DNA is striking because the chicken genome is one-third the size of human (1.25 pg versus 3 pg per haploid genome) and the sequencing and assembly of the chicken genome indicate an overall reduction of repetitive DNA (International Chicken Genome Sequencing Consortium 2004).  There are three classes of telomeric arrays in chicken: interstitial arrays of ~2 to 10 Kb, terminal arrays ranging from 10-40 Kb, and a second class of terminal arrays called mega-telomeres (also known as ultra-long) ranging from 50 Kb to several Mb (Delany et al. 2000).  The mega-telomeres show evidence of a high meiotic recombination rate and genotype-specific variation (Delany et al. 2003; Rodrigue et al. 2005; O'Hare and Delany 2009).  Despite these extremes in size and abundance, shown in the photomicrograph below, chicken telomeres closely resemble their human counterparts in sequence and organization (Nanda and Schmid 1994; Nikitina and Woodcock 2004).<p>Telomerase genes characterized in chicken include telomerase RNA (cTERC also known as cTR) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (cTERT) (Delany and Daniels 2003; Delany and Daniels 2004). Chicken TERC maps to GGA 9q and displays conservation of sequence, regulatory elements and synteny among viral, avian and mammalian genomes (Delany and Daniels 2003; Fragnet et al. 2003). The template (CR1) region of TERC is conserved between human and chicken (Chen et al. 2000). In addition to its role as the template for addition of telomeric sequence, TERC may be required for proliferation in DT40 cells as Faure et al. (2008) were unable to generate TERC-null DT40 cells by gene targeting. The chicken DT40 cell line was derived from an ALV transformed B cell lymphoma (Baba et al.1985) and possesses a high rate of homologous recombination. Therefore, it is widely used for transfection of genes or knockdown of expression to explore vertebrate gene function (Buerstedde et al. 1991; Winding and Berchtold 2001; Arakawa and Buerstedde 2006; Bachl et al. 2007).<p>The sequence and structure of the catalytic subunit cTERT, which maps to GGA 2q, is highly conserved with regions and motifs in common with human, Xenopus, mouse, rat and hamster TERTs (Delany and Daniels 2004). Chicken TERT (1346 amino acids) shares 45% amino acid identity with human TERT (1132 amino acids) (Delany and Daniels 2004). Interesting differences include a substantially larger region of the protein termed the flexible linker which is located near the N-terminus and includes 298 amino acids in chicken and only 155 in human. Comparisons between human and chicken 5' regulatory motifs are reviewed further in Delany and Daniels (2004). Both full length cTERT mRNA and numerous shorter mRNAs generated by alternative splicing have been described although the function of these splice variants remains to be clarified (Chang and Delany 2006; Hrdlickova et al. 2006).<p>In both chicken and human, telomerase activity in vivo is robust early in development, declines thereafter in most somatic tissues, yet remains active in renewable tissues (Taylor and Delany 2000). Telomerase activity is also present in most transformed cells examined thus far in both human and chicken (Newbold 2002; Swanberg and Delany 2003; Swanberg and Delany 2005). Telomerase component transcript analysis (gene expression) was examined and cTERC down-regulation correlates with absence of telomerase activity in telomerase negative cells, suggesting that cTERC may be the rate-limiting component in some cell types (O'Hare and Delany 2005; Swanberg and Delany 2005). Telomere shortening occurs in somatic tissues in vivo and correlates with age (Taylor and Delany 2000; Delany et al. 2003). Division-dependent telomere shortening is observed in non-immortalized, non-transformed chicken cells in vitro (Swanberg and Delany 2003).<p> In human, proteins involved in the protection of telomeres include the shelterin complex composed of TRF1, TRF2 and POT1 all of which recognize (TTAGGG)n sequence repeats and TIN2, TPP1 and RAP1 which are thought to interconnect with TRF1, TRF2 and POT1 (de Lange 2005; Palm and de Lange 2008). Known telomere-related proteins found in chicken include: TRF1 (Cooley et al. 2009), TRF2 (Konrad et al. 1999), POT1 (Wei and Price 2004), the chicken homolog of RAP1 (Tan and Price 2003) and tankyrases 1 and 2 (De Rycker et al. 2003).<p>The figure shows mitotic metaphase chromosomes from a UCD 001 (Red Jungle Fowl) female (2n=78, ZW) illustrating the chicken telomeric DNA profile.

    422355: '''Pancreatic beta cells integrate signals from several metabolites and hormones to control the secretion of insulin. In general, glucose triggers insulin secretion while other factors can amplify or inhibit the amount of insulin secreted in response to glucose. Factors which increase insulin secretion include the incretin hormones Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), acetylcholine, and fatty acids. Factors which inhibit insulin secretion include adrenaline and noradrenaline.<p>Increased blood glucose levels from dietary carbohydrate play a dominant role in  insulin release from the beta cells of the pancreas. Glucose catabolism in the beta cell is the transducer that links increased glucose levels to insulin release. Glucose uptake and glycolysis generate cytosolic pyruvate; pyruvate is transported to mitochondria and converted both to oxaloacetate which increases levels of TCA cycle intermediates, and to acetyl-CoA which is oxidized to CO2 via the TCA cycle. The rates of ATP synthesis and transport to the cytosol increase, plasma membrane ATP-sensitive inward rectifying potassium channels (KATP channels) close, the membrane depolarizes, and voltage-gated calcium channels in the membrane open (Muoio and Newgard 2008; Wiederkehr and Wollheim 2006).<p>Elevated calcium concentrations near the plasma membrane cause insulin secretion in two phases: an initial high rate within minutes of glucose stimulation and a slow, sustained release lasting longer than 30 minutes. In the initial phase, 50-100 insulin granules already docked at the membrane are exocytosed. Exocytosis is rendered calcium-dependent by Synaptotagmin V/IX, a calcium-binding membrane protein located in the membrane of the docked granule, although the exact action of Synapototagmin in response to calcium is unknown. Calcium also causes a translocation of reserve granules within the cell towards the plasma membrane for release in the second, sustained phase of secretion. Human cells contain L-type (continually reopening), P/Q-type (long burst), R-type (long burst), and T-type (short burst) calcium channels and these partly account for differences between the two phases of secretion. Other factors that distinguish the two phases are not yet fully known (Bratanova-Tochkova et al. 2002; Henquin 2000; MacDonald et al. 2005).''',

Polymerization of membrane-associated DVL and GSK3beta- and CSNK1-mediated phosphorylation of LRP5/6 establish a feed-forward mechanism for enhanced membrane recruitment of AXIN upon WNT signaling (Tamai et al, 2004; Cong et al, 2004; Zeng et al, 2005; Bilic et al, 2007).   In Xenopus oocytes, but not necessarily all sytems, AXIN is present in limiting concentrations and is considered rate limiting for the assembly of the destruction complex (Lee et al, 2003; Benchabane et al, 2008;  Tan et al, 2012; reviewed in MacDonald et al, 2009).  The recruitment of AXIN away from the destruction complex upon WNT stimulation effectively destabilizes the destruction complex and contributes to the accumulation of free beta-catenin (Kikuchi, 1999; Lee et al, 2003).  AXIN association with the destruction complex is also regulated by phosphorylation.  In the active destruction complex, AXIN is phosphorylated by GSK3beta; dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) or protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) destabilizes the interaction of AXIN with the other components of the destruction complex and promotes its disassembly (Luo et al, 2007; Willert et al, 1999; Jho et al, 1999).

Levels of these receptors at the cell surface are regulated in part by endocytosis, but the mechanisms are not fully elucidated (Garliardi et al, 2008).

ZNRF3 and RNF43 are E3 ligases that have been shown to ubiquitinate FZD proteins and promote their lysosomal degradation, while the deubiquitinating enzyme USP8 promotes recycling of the receptor back to the plasma membrane (Hao et al, 2012; Mukai et al, 2010).  This balance of ubiquitination and deubiquitination is in turn regulated by the R-spondin (RSPO) proteins, agonists of WNT signaling which appear to act by downregulating ZNRF3 and RNF43, thus potentiating both canonical and non-canonical pathways (Hao et al, 2012; reviewed in Abo and Clevers, 2012; Fearon and Spence, 2012, Papartriantafyllou, 2012).''',

    2060764: '''The FGFR3 gene has been shown to be subject to activating mutations and gene amplification leading to a variety of proliferative and developmental disorders depending on whether these events occur in the germline or arise somatically.  <br><br>Activating mutations in FGFR3 are associated with the development of a range of skeletal dysplasias that result in dwarfism (reviewed in Webster and Donoghue, 1997; Burke et al, 1998; Harada et al, 2009).  The most common form of human dwarfism is achondroplasia (ACH), which is caused by mutations G380R and G375C in the transmembrane domain of FGFR3 that are thought to promote ligand-independent dimerization (Rousseau et al, 1994; Shiang et al, 1994; Bellus et al, 1995a)  Hypochondroplasia (HCH) is a milder form dwarfism that is the result of mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR3 (Bellus et al, 1995b).  Two neonatal lethal conditions, thanatophoric dysplasia type I and II (TDI and TDII) are also the result of mutations in FGFR3; TDI arises from a range of mutations that either result in the formation of unpaired cysteine residues in the extracellular region that promote aberrant ligand-independent dimerization or by mutations that introduce stop codons (Rousseau et al, 1995; Rousseau et al, 1996, D'Avis et al,1998).  A single mutation, K650E in the second tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR3 is responsible for all identified cases of TDII (Tavormina et al, 1995a, b).  Other missense mutations at the same K650 residue give rise to Severe Achondroplasia with Developmental Disorders and Acanthosis Nigricans (SADDAN) syndrome (Tavormina et al, 1999; Bellus et al, 1999).   The severity of the phenotype arising from many of the activating FGFR3 mutations has recently been shown to correlate with the extent to which the mutations activate the receptor (Naski et al, 1996; Bellus et al, 2000) <br><br>In addition to mutations that cause dwarfism syndromes, a Pro250Arg mutation in the conserved dipeptide between the IgII and IgIII domains has been identified in an atypical craniosynostosis condition (Bellus et al, 1996; Reardon et al, 1997).  This mutation, which is paralogous to mutations seen in FGFR1 and 2 in Pfeiffer and Apert Syndrome, respectively, results in an increase in ligand-binding affinity for the receptor (Ibrahimi et al, 2004b).<br><br><br>Of all the FGF receptors, FGFR3 has perhaps the best established link to the development in cancer.  50% of bladder cancers have somatic mutations in the coding sequence of FGFR3; of these, more than half occur in the extracellular region at a single position (S249C) (Cappellen et al, 1999; Naski et al, 1996; di Martino et al, 2009, Sibley et al, 2001).  Activating mutations are also seen in the juxta- and trans-membrane domains, as well as in the kinase domain (reviewed in Weshe et al, 2011).  As is the case for the other receptors, many of the activating mutations that are seen in FGFR3-related cancers mimic the germline FGFR3 mutations that give rise to autosomal skeletal disorders and include both ligand-dependent and independent mechanisms (reviewed in Webster and Donoghue, 1997; Burke et al, 1998). In addition to activating mutations, the FGFR3 gene is subject to a translocation event in 15% of multiple myelomas (Avet-Loiseau et al, 1998; Chesi et al, 1997).  This chromosomal rearrangement puts the FGFR3 gene under the control of the highly active IGH promoter and promotes overexpression and constitutive activation of FGFR3.  In a small proportion of multiple myelomas, the translocation event is accompanied by activating mutations in the FGFR3 coding sequence (Chesi et al, 1997).<br><br>More recently, a number of fusion proteins of FGFR3 have been identified in various cancers (Singh et al, 2012; Williams et al, 2013; Parker et al, 2013; Wu et al, 2013; Wang et al, 2014; Yuan et al, 2014; reviewed in Parker et al, 2014).

The NFkB family of transcription factors is kept inactive in the cytoplasm by inhibitor of kappa B (IkB) family members (Oeckinghaus A and Ghosh S 2009). Canonical NFkB activation depends on the phosphorylation of IkB by the I kappa B kinase (IKK) complex, which contains two catalytic subunits named IKK alpha, IKK beta and a regulatory subunit named NFkB essential modulator (NEMO or IKBKG) (Rothwarf DM et al. 1998). Phosphorylation of IkB leads to K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of IkB, allowing translocation of NFkB factor to the nucleus, where it can activate transcription of a variety of genes participating in the immune and inflammatory response, cell adhesion, growth control, and protection against apoptosis (Collins T et al. 1995; Kaltschmidt B et al. 2000; Lawrence T 2009).<p>IKBKG is encoded by an X-linked gene. Null alleles of the gene are lethal in hemizygous males, whereas hypomorphic alleles typically result in the impaired NFkB signaling in patients with a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes in terms of both developmental defects and immunodeficiency (Döffinger R et al. 2001; Hanson EP et al. 2008). Several categories of mutations affecting IKBKG have been reported in humans (Döffinger R et al. 2001; Vinolo E et al. 2006; Fusko F et al. 2008). The first category of these mutations consists of hypomorphic mutations typically involving the zinc finger domain and nearby C-terminal regions and causing hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency (HED-ID) in males (Jain A et al. 2001; Shifera AS 2010).

    5624290: '''There are two classes of glutamate transporters; the excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) which depend on an electrochemical gradient of Na+ ions and vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) which are proton-dependent. Together, these transporters uptake and release glutamate to mediate this neurotransmitter's excitatory signal and are part of the glutamate-glutamine cycle. Three members of the SLC17A gene family (7, 6 and 8) encode VGLUTs 1-3 respectively. This uptake is thought to be coupled to the proton electrochemical gradient generated by the vacuolar type H+-ATPase. They are all expressed in the CNS in neuron-rich areas but SLC17A8 (VGLUT3) is also expressed on astrocytes and in the liver and kidney. Defects in SLC17A8 can cause autosomal dominant deafness 25 (DFNA25; MIM:605583), a form of non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. The cochlea expresses SLC17A8 and in mice which lack this transporter are congenitally deaf. Hearing loss is due to the lack of glutamate release by inner hair cells therefore a loss of synaptic transmission at the IHC-afferent nerve synapse. Successful restoration of hearing by gene replacement in mice could be a significant advance toward gene therapy of human deafness (Ruel et al. 2008, Akil et al. 2012).''',

Most circulating IGFs are in complexes with IGFBPs, which are believed to increase the residence of IGFs in the body, modulate availability of IGFs to target receptors for IGFs, reduce insulin like effects of IGFs, and act as signaling molecules independently of IGFs.
About 75% of circulating IGFs are in 1500 220 KDa complexes with IGFBP3 and ALS. Such complexes are too large to pass the endothelial barrier. The remaining 20 25% of IGFs are bound to other IGFBPs in 40 50 KDa complexes. IGFs are released from IGF:IGFBP complexes by proteolysis of the IGFBP. IGFs become active after release, however IGFs may also have activity when still bound to some IGFBPs.
IGFBP1 is enriched in amniotic fluid and is produced in the liver under control of insulin (insulin suppresses production). IGFBP1 binding stimulates IGF function. It is unknown which if any protease degrades IGFBP1.
IGFBP2 is enriched in cerebrospinal fluid; its binding inhibits IGF function. IGFBP2 is not significantly degraded in circulation.
IGFB3, which binds most IGF in the body is enriched in follicular fluid and found in many other tissues. IGFBP 3 may be cleaved by plasmin, thrombin, Prostate specific Antigen (PSA, KLK3), Matrix Metalloprotease-1 (MMP1), and Matrix Metalloprotease-2 (MMP2). IGFBP3 also binds extracellular matrix and binding lowers its affinity for IGFs. IGFBP3 binding stimulates the effects of IGFs.
IGFBP4 acts to inhibit IGF function and is cleaved by Pregnancy associated Plasma Protein A (PAPPA) to release IGF.
IGFBP5 is enriched in bone matrix; its binding stimulates IGF function. IGFBP5 is cleaved by Pregnancy Associated Plasma Protein A2 (PAPPA2), ADAM9, complement C1s from smooth muscle, and thrombin. Only the cleavage site for PAPPA2 is known.

    3371492: '''Attenuation of the heat shock transcriptional response occurs during continuous exposure to intermediate heat shock conditions or upon recovery from stress (Abravaya et al. 1991). The attenuation phase of HSF1 cycle involves the transcriptional silencing of HSF1 bound to HSE, the release of HSF1 trimers from HSE and dissociation of HSF1 trimers to monomers. HSF1-driven heat stress associated transcription was shown to depend on inducible and reversible acetylation of HSF1 at Lys80, which negatively regulates DNA binding activity of HSF1 (Westerheide SD et al. 2009). In addition, the attenuation of HSF1 activation takes place when enough HSP70/HSP40 is produced to saturate exposed hydrophobic regions of proteins damaged as a result of heat exposure. The excess HSP70/HSP40 binds to HSF1 trimer, which leads to its dissociation from the promoter and conversion to the inactive monomeric form (Abravaya et al. 1991; Shi Y et al. 1998). Interaction of HSP70 with the transcriptional corepressor repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor corepressor (CoREST) assists in terminating heat-shock response (Gomez AV et al. 2008).

Mast cells express both PLC-gamma1 and PLC-gamma2 isoforms and activation of these enzymes leads to conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). The production of IP3 leads to mobilization of intracellular Ca+2, which later results in a sustained Ca+2 flux response that is maintained by an influx of extracellular Ca+2.

In addition to having a sequence-specific DNA binding domain, HSF1 contains a C-terminal region which is involved in activating the transcription of the target genes (Green M et al. 1995). However, the transactivating ability of the transactivation domain itself is not stress sensitive. Rather, it's controled by a regulatory domain of HSF1 (amino acids 221-310), which represses the transactivating ability under normal physiological  conditions (Green M et al. 1995; Zuo J et al. 1995; Newton EM et al. 1996). The HSF1 transactivation domain can be divided into two distinct regions, activation domain 1 (AD1) and activation domain 2 (AD2) (Brown SA et al. 1998). AD1 and AD2 each contain residues that are important for both transcriptional initiation and elongation.

    2871819: '''Mast cells (MC) are distributed in tissues throughout the human body and have long been recognized as key cells of type I hypersensitivity reactions. They also play important roles in inflammatory and immediate allergic reactions. Activation through FCERI-bound antigen-specific IgE causes release of potent inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, proteases, chemotactic factors, cytokines and metabolites of arachidonic acid that act on the vasculature, smooth muscle, connective tissue, mucous glands and inflammatory cells (Borish & Joseph 1992, Amin 2012, Metcalfe et al. 1993). FCERI is a multimeric cell-surface receptor that binds the Fc fragment of IgE with high affinity. On mast cells and basophils FCERI exists as a tetrameric complex consisting of one alpha-chain, one beta-chain, and two disulfide-bonded gamma-chains, and on dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, macrophages, and eosinophils it exists as a trimeric complex with one alpha-chain and two disulfide-bonded gamma-chains (Wu 2011, Kraft & Kinet 2007). FCERI signaling in mast cells includes a network of signaling molecules and adaptor proteins. These molecules coordinate ultimately leading to effects on degranulation, eicosanoid production, and cytokine and chemokine production and cell migration and adhesion, growth and survival.<br>The first step in FCERI signaling is the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the ITAM of both the beta and the gamma subunits of the FCERI by LYN, which is bound to the FCERI beta-chain. The phosphorylated ITAM then recruits the protein tyrosine kinase SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase) which then phosphorylates the adaptor protein LAT. Phosphorylated LAT (linker for activation of T cells) acts as a scaffolding protein and recruits other cytosolic adaptor molecules GRB2 (growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2), GADS (GRB2-related adaptor protein), SHC (SRC homology 2 (SH2)-domain-containing transforming protein C) and SLP76 (SH2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa), as well as the exchange factors and adaptor molecules VAV and SOS (son of sevenless homologue), and the signalling enzyme phospholipase C gamma1 (PLC-gamma1). Tyrosoine phosphorylation of enzymes and adaptors, including VAV, SHC GRB2 and SOS stimulate small GTPases such as RAC, RAS and RAF. These pathways lead to activation of the ERK, JNK and p38 MAP kinases, histamine release and cytokine production. FCERI activation also triggers the phosphorylation of PLC-gamma which upon membrane localisation hydrolyse PIP2 to form IP3 and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) - second messengers that release Ca2+ from internal stores and activate PKC, respectively. Degranulation or histamine release follows the activation of PLC-gamma and protein kinase C (PKC) and the increased mobilization of calcium (Ca2+). Receptor aggregation also results in the phosphorylation of adaptor protein NTAL/LAT2 which then recruits GAB2. PI3K associates with phosphorylated GAB2 and catalyses the formation of PIP3 in the membrane, which attracts many PH domain proteins like BTK, PLC-gamma, AKT and PDK. PI3K mediated activation of AKT then regulate the mast cell proliferation, development and survival (Gu et al. 2001).''',

The AP-2 family transcription factors are evolutionarily conserved in metazoans and are characterized by a helix-span-helix motif at the C-terminus, a central basic region, and the transactivation domain at the N-terminus. The helix-span-helix motif and the basic region enable dimerization and DNA binding (Eckert et al. 2005).<p>AP-2 dimers bind palindromic GC-rich DNA response elements that match the consensus sequence 5'-GCCNNNGGC-3' (Williams and Tjian 1991a, Williams and Tjian 1991b). Transcriptional co-factors from the CITED family interact with the helix-span-helix (HSH) domain of TFAP2 (AP-2) family of transcription factors and recruit transcription co-activators EP300 (p300) and CREBBP (CBP) to TFAP2-bound DNA elements. CITED2 shows the highest affinity for TFAP2 proteins, followed by CITED4, while CITED1 interacts with TFAP2s with a very low affinity. Mouse embryos defective for CITED2 exhibit neural crest defects, cardiac malformations and adrenal agenesis, which can at least in part be attributed to a defective Tfap2 transactivation (Bamforth et al. 2001, Braganca et al. 2002, Braganca et al. 2003). Transcriptional activity of AP-2 dimers in inhibited by binding of KCTD1 or KCTD15 to the AP-2 transactivation domain (Ding et al. 2009, Zarelli and Dawid 2013). Transcriptional activity of TFAP2A, TFAP2B and TFAP2C is negatively regulated by SUMOylation mediated by UBE2I (UBC9) (Eloranta and Hurst 2002, Berlato et al. 2011, Impens et al. 2014, Bogachek et al. 2014).<p>During embryonic development, AP-2 transcription factors stimulate proliferation and suppress terminal differentiation in a cell-type specific manner (Eckert et al. 2005).<p>TFAP2A and TFAP2C directly stimulate transcription of the estrogen receptor ESR1 gene (McPherson and Weigel 1999). TFAP2A expression correlates with ESR1 expression in breast cancer, and TFAP2C is frequently overexpressed in estrogen-positive breast cancer and endometrial cancer (deConinck et al. 1995, Turner et al. 1998). TFAP2A, TFAP2C, as well as TFAP2B can directly stimulate the expression of ERBB2, another important breast cancer gene (Bosher et al. 1996). Association of TFAP2A with the YY1 transcription factor significantly increases the ERBB2 transcription rate (Begon et al. 2005). In addition to ERBB2, the expression of another receptor tyrosine kinase, KIT, is also stimulated by TFAP2A and TFAP2B (Huang et al. 1998), while the expression of the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase ligand VEGFA is repressed by TFAP2A (Ruiz et al. 2004, Li et al. 2012). TFAP2A stimulates transcription of the transforming growth factor alpha (TGFA) gene (Wang et al. 1997). TFAP2C regulates EGFR in luminal breast cancer (De Andrade et al. 2016).<p>TFAP2C plays a critical role in maintaining the luminal phenotype in human breast cancer and in influencing the luminal cell phenotype during normal mammary development (Cyr et al. 2015).<p>In placenta, TFAP2A and TFAP2C directly stimulate transcription of both subunits of the human chorionic gonadotropin, CGA and CGB (Johnson et al. 1997, LiCalsi et al. 2000).<p>TFAP2A and/or TFAP2C, in complex with CITED2, stimulate transcription of the PITX2 gene, involved in left-right patterning and heart development (Bamforth et al. 2004, Li et al. 2012).<p>TFAP2A and TFAP2C play opposing roles in transcriptional regulation of the CDKN1A (p21) gene locus.

GCCA and TCCA exist in the blood as complexes with serum albumin (ALB), and its uptake by SLCO1B1 must involve disruption of this complex, but the molecular mechanism coupling disruption and uptake is unknown. In the body, SLCO1B1 is expressed on the basolateral surfaces of hepatocytes and may play a role in the uptake of GCCA and TCCA by the liver under physiological conditions.

    5607956: '''Toll like receptor 3 (TLR3) recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), an intermediate product during viral replication for most viruses. TLR3 is expressed in various tissues and cells including cells of the central nervous system (CNS) (Bsibsi M et al. 2002). TLR3 activity in neurons and glial cells was found to be critical for controlling herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection in CNS (Lafaille FG et al. 2012). Children with inborn errors of TLR3-mediated immunity are prone to HSV-1 encephalitis (HSE), a rare life-threatening complication during HSV-1 infection (Casrouge A et al. 2006; Perez de Diego R et al. 2010; Zhang SY et al. 2007; Herman M et al. 2012; Lafaille FG et al. 2012). The functional defect in HSE patients with TLR3 deficiency is probably due to impaired induction of type I and III interferon (IFN) by cells of the CNS, which appears to be uniquely dependent upon TLR3 for protection against HSV1 (Zhang SY et al. 2007; Guo Y et al. 2011; Lafaille FG et al. 2012).

    397841: '''Thrombin activates proteinase activated receptors (PARs) that signal through heterotrimeric G proteins of the G12/13 and Gq families, thereby connecting to a host of intracellular signaling pathways. Thrombin activates PARs by cleaving an N-terminal peptide that then binds to the body of the receptor to effect transmembrane signaling. Intermolecular ligation of one PAR molecule by another can occur but is less efficient than self-ligation. A synthetic peptide of sequence SFLLRN, the first six amino acids of the new N-terminus generated when thrombin cleaves PAR1, can activate PAR1 independent of protease and receptor cleavage. PARs are key to platelet activation. Four PARs have been identified, of which PARs 1 ,3 and 4 are substrates for thrombin. In humans PAR 1 is the predominant thrombin receptor followed by PAR4 which is less responsive to thrombin. PAR 3 is not considered important for human platelet responses as it is minimally expressed, though this is not the case for mouse. PAR2 is not expressed in platelets. In mouse platelets, Gq is necessary for platelet secretion and aggregation in response to thrombin but is not necessary for thrombin-triggered shape change. G13 appears to contribute to platelet aggregation as well as shape change in response to low concentrations of thrombin but to be unnecessary at higher agonist concentrations; G12 appears to be dispensable for thrombin signaling in platelets. G alpha (q) activates phospholipase C beta thereby triggering phosphoinositide hydrolysis, calcium mobilization and protein kinase C activation. This provides a path to calcium-regulated kinases and phosphatases, GEFs, MAP kinase cassettes and other proteins that mediate cellular responses ranging from granule secretion, integrin activation, and aggregation in platelets. Gbeta:gamma subunits can activate phosphoinositide-3 kinase and other lipid modifying enzymes, protein kinases, and channels. PAR1 activation indirectly leads to activation of cell surface 'sheddases' that liberate ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases, providing a link between thrombin and receptor tyrosine kinases involved in cell growth and differentiation. The pleiotrophic effects of PAR activation are consistent with many of thrombin's diverse actions on cells. ''',

Upon ligand binding, TLR5 dimers recruit MyD88 through their TIR domains. Then, MyD88 oligomerizes via its death domain (DD) and TIR domain and interacts with the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) to form the Myddosome complex (MyD88:IRAK4:IRAK1/2) (Motshwene PG et al. 2009; Lin SC et al. 2010). The Myddosome complex transmits the signal leading to activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkB) and activator protein 1 (AP1). Studies have identified patients with autosomal recessive (AR) form of IRAK4 deficiency, a health condition with clinical manifestation in infancy or early childhood, that predisposes affected patients to recurrent pyogenic bacterial infection (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus) (Picard C et al. 2003; Ku CL et al. 2007; Picard C et al. 2010; Picard C et al. 2011). Leukocytes derived from IRAK4-deficient patients display a lack of production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta or a lack of CD62 ligand (CD62L) shedding from granulocytes following activation with flagellin, the TLR5 agonist (Picard C et al. 2003; McDonald DR et al. 2006; Ku CL et al. 2007). Patients with AR IRAK4 deficiency were found to bear homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the IRAK4 gene (Picard C et al. 2003; Ku CL et al. 2007; McDonald DR et al. 2006). Here we describe selective mutations, that have been functionally characterized. Cell-based assays as well as in vitro protein-interaction analyses with IRAK4 variants showed that the loss-of-function of defective IRAK4 can be caused by either an abolished protein production as a result of nonsense mutations (e.g.,Q293X and E402X)  or an impaired interaction with MyD88 due to missense mutations (e.g., R12C) (Ku CL et al. 2007; Yamamoto T et al. 2014).<p>IRAK4 mediates immune responses downstream of all TLRs except for TLR3. Besides defective TLR5 signaling, the Reactome module describes the impact of functional deficiency of IRAK4 on TLR2/4 signaling pathways. We did not include defective TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 signaling events, which are stimulated by nucleic acids upon viral infections, although studies using patients-derived blood cells have showed abolished cytokines production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and lack of CD62 ligand (CD62L) shedding from granulocytes in response to TLR7-9 agonists, i.e.,3M-13 (TLR7), 3M-2 (TLR8), R848 (TLR7 and 8) and CpG (TLR9) (McDonald DR et al. 2006; von Bernuth H et al. 2006; Ku CL et al. 2007). In addition to TLR-NFkB signaling axis the endosomic TLR7-9 activate IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma responses, which have been also impaired in IRAK4-deficient PBMC (Yang K et al. 2005). However, IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma production in response to 9 of 11 viruses tested was normal or weakly affected in IRAK-4-deficient blood cells, suggesting that IRAK-4-deficient patients may control viral infections by TLR7-9-independent production of IFNs (Yang K et al. 2005).

Binding of estrogen receptors to the DNA promotes the assembly of higher order transcriptional complexes containing methyltransferases, histone acetyltransferases and other transcriptional activators, which promote transcription by establishing active chromatin marks and by recruiting general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. ESR1- and estrogen-dependent recruitment of up to hundreds of coregulators has been demonstrated by varied co-immunoprecipitation and proteomic approaches (Kittler et al, 2013; Mohammed et al, 2013; Foulds et al, 2013; Mohammed et al, 2015; Liu et al, 2014; reviewed in Magnani and Lupien, 2014; Arnal, 2017). In some circumstances, ligand-bound receptors can also promote the assembly of a repression complex at a target gene, and in some cases, heterodimers of ESR1 and ESR2 serve as repressors of ESR1-mediated target gene activation (reviewed in Hah and Kraus, 2014; Arnal et al, 2017).  Phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor also modulates its activity, and provides cross-talk between nuclear estrogen-dependent signaling and non-genomic estrogen signaling from the plasma membrane (reviewed in Anbalagan and Rowan, 2015; Halodsèn et al, 2014; Schwartz et al, 2016) <br><br>A number of recent genome wide studies highlight the breadth of the transcriptional response to estrogen. The number of predicted estrogen-dependent target genes ranges from a couple of hundred (based on microarray studies) to upwards of 10000, based on ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq (Cheung and Kraus, 2010; Kinnis and Kraus, 2008; Lin et al, 2004; Welboren et al, 2009; Ikeda et al, 2015; Lin et al, 2007; Carroll et al, 2006). Many of these predicted sites may not represent transcriptionally productive binding events, however. A study examining ESR1 binding by ChIP-seq in 20 primary breast cancers identified a core of 484 ESR-binding events that were conserved in at least 75% of ER+ tumors, which may represent a more realistic estimate (Ross-Innes et al, 2012). These studies also highlight the long-range effect of estrogen receptor-binding, with distal enhancer or promoter elements regulating the expression of many target genes, often through looping or other higher order chromatin structures (Kittler et al, 2013; reviewed in Dietz and Carroll, 2008; Liu and Cheung, 2014; Magnani and Lupien, 2014). Transcription from a number of estrogen-responsive target genes also appears to be primed by the binding of pioneering transcription factors such as FOXA1, GATA3, PBX1 among others. These factors bind to heterochromatin by virtue of their winged helix domains and promote chromatin opening, allowing subsequent recruitment of other transcription factors (reviewed in Zaret and Carroll, 2011; Fiorito et al, 2013; Arnal et al, 2017; Magnani et al, 2011)''',

During steady state conditions, cytoplasmic Ca2+ is reduced by the accumulation of Ca2+ in intracellular stores and by Ca2+ extrusion. The primary intracellular calcium store in platelets is the dense tubular system, the equivalent of the ER system in other cell types. Ca2+ is extruded by Ca2+-ATPases including plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPases (PMCAs) and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase isoforms (SERCAs). <br><br>Activation of non- excitable cells involves the agonist-induced elevation of cytosolic Ca2+, an essential process for platelet activation.

Ca2+ store release involves phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated production of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which in turn stimulates IP3 receptor channels to release Ca2+ from intracellular stores. This is followed by Ca2+ entry into the cell through plasma membrane calcium channels, a process referred to as store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), a Ca2+ sensor molecule in intracellular stores, and the four transmembrane channel protein Orai1 are the key players in platelet SOCE. Other major Ca2+ entry mechanisms are mediated by the direct receptor-operated calcium (ROC) channel, P2X1 and transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs).''',

They share structural homology within their catalytic domains and have similar mechanisms of activation. Mammals have three AKT genes, named RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT1, PKB, PKB-alpha), RAC-beta serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT2, PKB-beta and RAC-gamma serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT3, PKB-gamma, STK2). All share a conserved domain structure: an amino terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a central kinase domain and a carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain that contains a hydrophobic motif that is characteristic of AGC kinases. The PH domain interacts with membrane lipid products such as phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate (PIP3) produced by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase). Biochemical analysis. The PH domain of AKT binds to PIP3 and PIP2 with similar affinity (James et al. 1996, Frech et al. 1997). The kinase catalytic domain of Akt/PKB is highly similar to other AGC kinases (Peterson & Schreiber 1999). Phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in this region (T308 in AKT1) results in partial activation (Alessi et al. 1996). The carboxyl terminal extension has the hydrophobic motif FPQFSY.

    6783551: '''The interleukin-6 (IL6) family of cytokines includes IL6, IL11, IL27, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin 1 and 2 (CT-1) and cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) (Heinrich et al. 2003, Pflanz et al. 2002). The latest addition to this family is IL31, discovered in 2004 (Dillon et al. 2004). The family is defined largely by the shared use of the common signal transducing receptor Interleukin-6 receptor subunit beta (IL6ST, gp130). The IL31 receptor uniquely does not include this subunit, instead it uses the related IL31RA. The members of the IL6 family share very low sequence homology but are structurally highly related, forming anti-parallel four-helix bundles with a characteristic “up-up-down-down” topology (Rozwarski et al. 1994, Cornelissen et al. 2012).<br><br>Although each member of the IL6 family signals through a distinct receptor complex, their underlying signaling mechanisms are similar. Assembly of the receptor complex is followed by activation of receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAKs), believed to be constitutively associated with the receptor subunits.Activation of JAKs initiates downstream cytoplasmic signaling cascades that involve recruitment and phosphorylation of transcription factors of the Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family, which dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they bind enhancer elements of target genes leading to transcriptional activation (Nakashima & Taga 1998).<br><br>Negative regulators of IL6 signaling include Suppressor of cytokine signals (SOCS) family members and PTPN11 (SHP-2).<br><br>IL6 is a pleiotropic cytokine with roles in processes including immune regulation, hematopoiesis, inflammation, oncogenesis, metabolic control and sleep. <br><br>IL6 and IL11 bind their corresponding specific receptors IL6R and IL11R respectively, resulting in dimeric complexes that subsequently associate with IL6ST, leading to IL6ST homodimer formation (in a hexameric or higher order complex) and signal initiation. IL6R alpha exists in transmembrane and soluble forms. The transmembrane form is mainly expressed by hepatocytes, neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and some lymphocytes. Soluble forms of IL6R (sIL6R) are also expressed by these cells. Two major mechanisms for the production of sIL6R have been proposed. Alternative splicing generates a transcript lacking the transmembrane domain by using splicing donor and acceptor sites that flank the transmembrane domain coding region. This also introduces a frameshift leading to the incorporation of 10 additional amino acids at the C terminus of sIL6R.A second mechanism for the generation of sIL6R is the proteolytic cleavage or 'shedding' of membrane-bound IL-6R. Two proteases ADAM10 and ADAM17 are thought to contribute to this (Briso et al. 2008). sIL6R can bind IL6 and stimulate cells that express gp130 but not IL6R alpha, a process that is termed trans-signaling. This explains why many cells, including hematopoietic progenitor cells, neuronal cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and embryonic stem cells, do not respond to IL6 alone, but show a remarkable response to IL6/sIL6R. It is clear that the trans-signaling pathway is responsible for the pro-inflammatory activities of IL6 whereas the membrane bound receptor governs regenerative and anti-inflammatory IL6 activities<br><br>LIF, CNTF, OSM, CTF1, CRLF1 and CLCF1 signal via IL6ST:LIFR heterodimeric receptor complexes (Taga & Kishimoto 1997, Mousa & Bakhiet 2013).

Homozygous Smad4 loss is embryonic lethal in mice (Takaku et al. 1998). Smad4 +/- heterozygotes appear normal but develop intestinal polyps between 6 and12 months of age and these polyps can progress to cancer. Loss of the remaining wild-type Smad4 allele is detectable only at later stages of tumor progression in Smad4+/- mice (Xu et al. 2000).

AFB1 can be oxidised to the toxic AFB1 exo 8,9 epoxide (AFXBO) product by several cytochrome P450 enzymes, especially P450 3A4 in the liver. This 8,9 epoxide can react with the N7 atom of a guanyl base of DNA to produce adducts by intercalating between DNA base pairs. The exo epoxide is unstable in solution, however, and can react spontaneously to form a diol that is no longer reactive with DNA. The diol product in turn undergoes base-catalysed rearrangement to a dialdehyde that can react with protein lysine residues. AFB1 can also be metabolised to products (AFQ1, AFM1, AFM1E) which have far less genotoxic consequences than AFB1. The main route of detoxification of AFB1 is conjugation of its reactive 8,9-epoxide form with glutathione (GSH). This reaction is carried out by trimeric glutathione transferases (GSTs), providing a chemoprotective mechanism against toxicity.

ECM remodeling is involved in the regulation of cell differentiation processes such as the establishment and maintenance of stem cell niches, branching morphogenesis, angiogenesis, bone remodeling, and wound repair. Redundant mechanisms modulate the expression and function of ECM modifying enzymes. Abnormal ECM dynamics can lead to deregulated cell proliferation and invasion, failure of cell death, and loss of cell differentiation, resulting in congenital defects and pathological processes including tissue fibrosis and cancer.<br><br>Collagen is the most abundant fibrous protein within the ECM constituting up to 30% of total protein in multicellular animals. Collagen provides tensile strength. It associates with elastic fibres, composed of elastin and fibrillin microfibrils, which give tissues the ability to recover after stretching. Other ECM proteins such as fibronectin, laminins, and matricellular proteins participate as connectors or linking proteins (Daley et al. 2008).<br><br>Chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate and keratan sulfate proteoglycans are structural components associated with collagen fibrils (Scott & Haigh 1985; Scott & Orford 1981), serving to tether the fibril to the surrounding matrix. Decorin belongs to the small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan family (SLRPs) which also includes biglycan, fibromodulin, lumican and asporin. All appear to be involved in collagen fibril formation and matrix assembly (Ameye & Young 2002). <br><br>ECM proteins such as osteonectin (SPARC), osteopontin and thrombospondins -1 and -2, collectively referred to as matricellular proteins (reviewed in Mosher & Adams 2012) appear to modulate cell-matrix interactions. In general they induce de-adhesion, characterized by disruption of focal adhesions and a reorganization of actin stress fibers (Bornstein 2009).  Thrombospondin (TS)-1 and -2 bind MMP2. The resulting complex is endocytosed by the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), clearing MMP2 from the ECM (Yang et al. 2001).<br><br>Osteopontin (SPP1, bone sialoprotein-1) interacts with collagen and fibronectin (Mukherjee et al. 1995). It also contains several cell adhesive domains that interact with integrins and CD44.<br><br>Aggrecan is the predominant ECM proteoglycan in cartilage (Hardingham & Fosang 1992). Its relatives include versican, neurocan and brevican (Iozzo 1998). In articular cartilage the major non-fibrous macromolecules are aggrecan, hyaluronan and hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1 (HAPLN1). The high negative charge density of these molecules leads to the binding of large amounts of water (Bruckner 2006). Hyaluronan is bound by several large proteoglycans proteoglycans belonging to the hyalectan family that form high-molecular weight aggregates (Roughley 2006), accounting for the turgid nature of  cartilage. <br><br>The most significant enzymes in ECM remodeling are the Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP) and A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) families (Cawston & Young 2010). Other notable ECM degrading enzymes include plasmin and cathepsin G. Many ECM proteinases are initially present as precursors, activated by proteolytic processing. MMP precursors include an amino prodomain which masks the catalytic Zn-binding motif (Page-McCawet al. 2007). This can be removed by other proteinases, often other MMPs. ECM proteinases can be inactivated by degradation, or blocked by inhibitors. Some of these inhibitors, including alpha2-macroglobulin, alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, and alpha1-chymotrypsin can inhibit a large variety of proteinases (Woessner & Nagase 2000). The tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are potent MMP inhibitors (Brew & Nagase 2010).''',

Diphosphorylated AUF1 bound to RNA recruits additional proteins, including eIF4G, polyA-binding protein, Hsp, Hsc70, Hsp27, NSEP-1, NSAP-1, and IMP-2 which target the mRNA and AUF1 for degradation. Unphosphorylated AUF1 is thought to be less able to recruit additional proteins. AUF1 also interacts directly or indirectly with HuR and the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).<br>AUF1 complexed with RNA and other proteins is ubiquitinated and targeted for destruction by the proteasome while the bound mRNA is degraded. Inhibition of ubiquitin addition to AUF1 blocks mRNA degradation.

    111206: '''5-Phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP) is a key intermediate in both the de novo and salvage pathways of purine and pyrimidine synthesis.  PRPP and the enzymatic activity responsible for its synthesis were first described by Kornberg et al. (1955). The enzyme, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1, has been purified from human erythrocytes and characterized biochemically. The purified enzyme readily forms multimers; its smallest active form appears to be a dimer and for simplicity it is annotated as a dimer here. It specifically catalyzes the transfer of pyrophosphate from ATP or dATP to D-ribose 5-phosphate, and has an absolute requirement for Mg++ and orthophosphate (Fox and Kelley 1971; Roth et al. 1974). The significance of the reaction with dATP in vivo is unclear, as the concentration of cytosolic dATP is normally much lower than that of ATP. The importance of this enzyme for purine synthesis in vivo has been established by demonstrating excess phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase activity, correlated with elevated enzyme levels or altered enzyme properties, in individuals whose rates of uric acid production are constitutively abnormally high (Becker and Kim 1987; Roessler et al. 1993).<P>Molecular cloning studies have revealed the existence of two additional genes that encode phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase-like proteins, one widely expressed (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 2) and one whose expression appears to be confined to the testis (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1-like 1) (Taira et al. 1989; 1991). Neither of these proteins has been purified and characterized enzymatically, nor have variations in the abundance or sequence of either protein been associated with alterations in human nucleotide metabolism (Roessler et al. 1993; Becker et al. 1996), so their dimerization and ability to catalyze the synthesis of PRPP from D-ribose 5-phosphate are inferred here on the basis of their predicted amino acid sequence similarity to phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1.''',

Another region of SMAD2 and SMAD3 that is frequently mutated in cancer is the phosphorylation motif Ser-Ser-X-Ser at the very C-terminus (Fleming et al. 2013). The phosphorylation of this conserved motif by the activated TGF-beta receptor complex is an essential step in SMAD2 and SMAD3 activation and a prerequisite for the formation of heterotrimers with SMAD4 (Chacko et al. 2001, Chacko et al. 2004).<br><br>Smad2 knockout mice die at embryonic day 8.5, with impaired visceral endoderm function and deficiency in mesoderm formation.

Therefore, loss of Smad2 does not contribute to initiation of intestinal tumorigenesis, but accelerates malignant progression (Hamamoto et al. 2002). Smad3 knockout mice are viable and fertile but die between 4 and 6 months of age from colorectal adenocarcinoma (Zhu et al. 1998), indicating that the loss of Smad3 initiates intestinal tumorigenesis.''',

    918133: '''GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. GABA modulates neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system. Disruption of GABA neurotransmission leads to many neurological diseases including epilepsy and a general anxiety disorder. GABA is synthesized by two distinct enzymes GAD67 and GAD65 that differ in their cellular localization, functional properties and co-factor requirements. GABA synthesized by GAD65 is used for neurotransmission whereas GABA synthesized by GAD67 is used for processes other than neurotransmission such as synaptogenesis and protection against neuronal injury. GABA is loaded into synaptic vesicle with the help of vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter or VGAT. GAD65 and VGAT are functionally linked at the synaptic vesicle membrane and GABA synthesized by GAD65 is preferentially loaded into the synaptic vesicle over GABA synthesized in cytoplasm by GAD67.The GABA loaded synaptic vesicles are docked at the plasma membrane with the help of the SNARE complexes and primed by interplay between various proteins including Munc18, complexin etc. Release of GABA loaded synaptic vesicle is initiated by the arrival of action potential at the presynaptic bouton and opening of N or P/Q voltage gated Ca2+ channels. Ca2+ influx results in Ca2+ binding by synaptobrevin, which is a part of the SNARE complex that also includes SNAP25 and syntaxin, leading to synaptic vesicle fusion.

They are a major cell type in the inner cell mass of the early embryo in vivo, and cells with the same properties, induced pluripotent stem cells, can be generated in vitro from differentiated adult cells by overexpression of a set of transcription factor genes (Takahashi and Yamanaka 2006, Takahashi et al. 2007, Yu et al. 2007, Jaenisch and Young 2008, Stein et al. 2012, reviewed in Dejosez and Zwaka 2012).<br>Pluripotency is maintained by a self-reinforcing loop of transcription factors (Boyer et al. 2005, Rao et al. 2006, Matoba et al. 2006, Player et al. 2006, Babaie et al. 2007, Sun et al. 2008, Assou et al. 2009, reviewed in Kashyap et al. 2009, reviewed in Dejosez and Zwaka 2012). In vivo, initiation of pluripotency may depend on maternal factors transmitted through the oocyte (Assou et al. 2009) and on DNA demethylation in the zygote (recently reviewed in Seisenberger et al. 2013) and hypoxia experienced by the blastocyst in the reproductive tract before implantation (Forristal et al. 2010, reviewed in Mohyeldin et al. 2010). In vitro, induced pluripotency may initiate with demethylation and activation of the promoters of POU5F1 (OCT4) and NANOG (Bhutani et al. 2010). Hypoxia also significantly enhances conversion to pluripotent stem cells (Yoshida et al. 2009). POU5F1 and NANOG, together with SOX2, encode central factors in pluripotency and activate their own transcription (Boyer et al 2005, Babaie et al. 2007, Yu et al. 2007, Takahashi et al. 2007). The autoactivation loop maintains expression of POU5F1, NANOG, and SOX2 at high levels in stem cells and, in turn, complexes containing various combinations of these factors (Remenyi et al. 2003, Lam et al. 2012) activate the expression of a group of genes whose products are associated with rapid cell proliferation and repress the expression of a group of genes whose products are associated with cell differentiation (Boyer et al. 2005, Matoba et al. 2006, Babaie et al. 2007, Chavez et al. 2009, Forristal et al. 2010, Guenther 2011).<br>Comparisons between human and mouse embryonic stem cells must be made with caution and for this reason inferences from mouse have been used sparingly in this module. Human ESCs more closely resemble mouse epiblast stem cells in having inactivated X chromosomes, flattened morphology, and intolerance to passaging as single cells (Hanna et al. 2010). Molecularly, human ESCs differ from mouse ESCs in being maintained by FGF and Activin/Nodal/TGFbeta signaling rather than by LIF and canonical Wnt signaling (Greber et al. 2010, reviewed in Katoh 2011). In human ESCs POU5F1 binds and directly activates the FGF2 gene, however Pou5f1 does not activate Fgf2 in mouse ESCs (reviewed in De Los Angeles et al. 2012). Differences in expression patterns of KLF2, KLF4, KLF5, ESRRB, FOXD3, SOCS3, LIN28, NODAL were observed between human and mouse ESCs (Cai et al. 2010) as were differences in expression of EOMES, ARNT and several other genes (Ginis et al.2004).''',
    5251716: '''Botulinum toxin type B (BoNT/B), a disulfide-bonded heavy chain (HC) - light chain (LC) heterodimer, enters the gut typically as a result of consuming contaminated food (Hatheway 1995), as a complex with nontoxic nonhemagglutinin protein  (NTNHA, encoded by the C. botulinum ntnha gene) and multiple copies of three hemagglutinin proteins (HA, encoded by the C. botulinum ha17, ha34, and ha70 genes) (Amatsu et al. 2013). The complex protects the toxin from degradation in the gut and mediates its association with the gut epithelium and transcytosis to enter the circulation (Fujinaga et al. 2013). Circulating toxin molecules associate with gangliosides and synaptotagmin (SYT) proteins exposed by exocytosis at a synapse of a target neuron (Dong et al. 2003; Yowler & Schengrund 2004). Vesicle recycling brings the toxin into the neuron where the vesicle is acidified (Sudhoff 2004). The lowered pH induces a conformational change in the toxin: its HC forms a passage in the vesicle membrane through which its LC is extruded into the neuronal cytosol. Tthe HC - LC disulfide bond is reduced (Montal 2010). The LC then catalyzes the cleavage of vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) on the cytosolic face of synaptic vesicle membranes (Foran et al. 1994; Schiavo et al. 1992), thereby inhibiting synaptic vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane and exocytosis.''',

Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID (MPS IIID, Sanfilippo syndrome D, MIM:252940) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder due to the loss of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-sulfatase (GNS; MIM:607664), that hydrolyses the 6-sulfate groups of the N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-sulfate units of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) heparan sulfate and keratan sulfate. GNS is localized to chromosome 12q14 and has 14 exons spanning 46 kb (Robertson et al. 1988, Mok et al. 2003). Loss of enzyme activity leads to lysosomal accumulation and urinary excretion of  heparan sulfate and N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate residues (Mok et al. 2003). Keratan sulphate does not accumulate in MPS IIID, as beta-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-sulphate can be cleaved by beta-hexosaminidase A (Kresse et al. 1980). This disorder is characterized by progressive mental deterioration but only moderate physical abnormalities and death duing the second or third decade of life, presenting a phenotype similar to MPSIIIA (Jones et al. 1997, de Ruijter et al. 2011).''',

    111246: '''While the single nucleotide replacement pathway appears to facilitate the repair of most damaged bases, an alternative BER pathway is evoked when the structure of the 5'-terminal sugar phosphate is such that it cannot be cleaved through the AP lyase activity of DNA polymerase beta (POLB). Under these circumstances, a short stretch of residues containing the abasic site is excised and replaced (Dianov et al., 1999). Following DNA glycosylase-mediated cleavage of the damaged base, the endonuclease APEX1 is recruited to the site of damage where it cleaves the 5' side of the abasic deoxyribose residue, as in the single nucleotide replacement pathway. However, POLB then synthesizes the first replacement residue without prior cleavage of the 5'-terminal sugar phosphate, hence displacing this entity. Long-patch BER can be completed by continued POLB-mediated DNA strand displacement synthesis in the presence of PARP1 or PARP2, FEN1 and DNA ligase I (LIG1) (Prasad et al. 2001). When the PCNA-containing replication complex is available, as is the case with cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle, DNA strand displacement synthesis is catalyzed by DNA polymerase delta (POLD) or DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) complexes, in the presence of PCNA, RPA, RFC, APEX1, FEN1 and LIG1 (Klungland and Lindahl 1997, Dianova et al. 2001). In both POLB-dependent and PCNA-dependent DNA displacement synthesis, the displaced DNA strand containing the abasic sugar phosphate creates a flap structure that is recognized and cleaved by the flap endonuclease FEN1. The replacement residues added by POLB or POLD/POLE are then ligated by the DNA ligase I (LIG1) (Klungland and Lindahl, 1997; Matsumoto et al., 1999).<br><br>''',

Signaling by these sensors promotes the activation and nuclear translocation of transcription factors (IRFs, NFkB and AP1). The transcription factors induce secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF and pro-IL1beta that direct the adaptive immune response. Inherited or acquired abnormalities in TLR-mediated processes may lead to increased susceptibility to infection, excessive inflammation, autoimmunity and malignancy (Picard C et al. 2010; Netea MG et al. 2012; Varettoni M et al. 2013).

First, MyD88 or IRAK4 deficiency is characterized with a greater susceptibility to pyogenic bacteria in affected patients (Picard C et al. 2003; von Bernuth H et al. 2008). Second, defects in the TLR3 signaling pathway are associated with a greater susceptibility to herpes simplex virus encephalitis (Zhang SY et al. 2013).

    418458: '''Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is an important secondary messenger synthesized by guanylate cyclases. cGMP has effects on phosphodiesterases (PDE), ion-gated channels, and the cGMP-dependent protein kinases (cGK, Protein Kinase G or PKG). It is involved in regulation of  several physiological functions including vasodilation, platelet aggregation and neurotransmission.  Elevation of intracellular cGMP activates PKG (Haslam et al. 1999) which regulates several intracellular molecules and pathways including the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) (Halbrugge et al. 1990) and the ERK pathway (Hood and Granger 1998, Li et al. 2001). cGMP mediates nitric oxide (NO)-induced vascular smooth muscle relaxation (Furchgott and Vanhoutte 1989). Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) hydrolyzes cGMP; the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil (Viagra) increases intracellular cGMP and thereby can be used as a treatment for erectile dysfunction (Corbin and Francis 1999). The role of the cGMP and PKG in platelet activation was controversial as increases in platelet cGMP levels were observed in response to both platelet agonists (thrombin, ADP or collagen) and inhibitors (NO donors such as sodium nitroprusside), but it is currently accepted that PKG inhibits platelet activation (Haslam et al. 1999). Consistent with this, nitric oxide (NO) donors that inhibit platelet activation enhance intracellular cGMP (Haslam et al. 1999). cGMP also plays an important stimulatory role in GPIb-IX-mediated platelet activation. Platelet responses to cGMP have been proposed to be biphasic, consisting of an early stimulatory response that promotes platelet activation followed by a delayed platelet inhibition that serves to limit the size of platelet aggregates  (Li et al 2003).''',

    6804148: '''Under a variety of stress conditions, TP53 (p53), stabilized by stress-induced phosphorylation at least on S15 and S20 serine residues, can induce the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle arrest. Cell cycle arrest provides cells an opportunity to repair the damage before division, thus preventing the transmission of genetic errors to daughter cells. In addition, it allows cells to attempt a recovery from the damage and survive, preventing premature cell death.<p>TP53 controls transcription of genes involved in both G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest. The most prominent TP53 target involved in G1 arrest is the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases CDKN1A (p21). CDKN1A is one of the earliest genes induced by TP53 (El-Deiry et al. 1993). CDKN1A binds and inactivates CDK2 in complex with cyclin A (CCNA) or E (CCNE), thus preventing G1/S transition (Harper et al. 1993). Nevertheless, under prolonged stress, the cell destiny may be diverted towards an apoptotic outcome. For instance, in case of an irreversible damage, TP53 can induce transcription of an RNA binding protein PCBP4, which can bind and destabilize CDKN1A mRNA, thus alleviating G1 arrest and directing the affected cell towards G2 arrest and, possibly, apoptosis (Zhu and Chen 2000, Scoumanne et al. 2011). Expression of E2F7 is directly induced by TP53. E2F7 contributes to G1 cell cycle arrest by repressing transcription of E2F1, a transcription factor that promotes expression of many genes needed for G1/S transition (Aksoy et al. 2012, Carvajal et al. 2012). ARID3A is a direct transcriptional target of TP53 (Ma et al. 2003) that may promote G1 arrest by cooperating with TP53 in induction of CDKN1A transcription (Lestari et al. 2012). However, ARID3A may also promote G1/S transition by stimulating transcriptional activity of E2F1 (Suzuki et al. 1998, Peeper et al. 2002).<p>TP53 contributes to the establishment of G2 arrest by inducing transcription of GADD45A and SFN, and by inhibiting transcription of CDC25C. TP53 induces GADD45A transcription in cooperation with chromatin modifying enzymes EP300, PRMT1 and CARM1 (An et al. 2004). GADD45A binds Aurora kinase A (AURKA), inhibiting its catalytic activity and preventing AURKA-mediated G2/M transition (Shao et al. 2006, Sanchez et al. 2010). GADD45A also forms a complex with PCNA. PCNA is involved in both normal and repair DNA synthesis. The effect of GADD45 interaction with PCNA, if any, on S phase progression, G2 arrest and DNA repair is not known (Smith et al. 1994, Hall et al. 1995, Sanchez et al. 2010, Kim et al. 2013). SFN (14-3-3-sigma) is induced by TP53 (Hermeking et al. 1997) and contributes to G2 arrest by binding to the complex of CDK1 and CCNB1 (cyclin B1) and preventing its translocation to the nucleus. Phosphorylation of a number of nuclear proteins by the complex of CDK1 and CCNB1 is needed for G2/M transition (Chan et al. 1999). While promoting G2 arrest, SFN can simultaneously inhibit apoptosis by binding to BAX and preventing its translocation to mitochondria, a step involved in cytochrome C release (Samuel et al. 2001). TP53 binds the promoter of the CDC25C gene in cooperation with the transcriptional repressor E2F4 and represses CDC25C transcription, thus maintaining G2 arrest (St Clair et al. 2004, Benson et al. 2014).<p>Several direct transcriptional targets of TP53 are involved in cell cycle arrest but their mechanism of action is still unknown. BTG2 is induced by TP53, leading to cessation of cellular proliferation (Rouault et al. 1996, Duriez et al. 2002). BTG2 binds to the CCR4-NOT complex and promotes mRNA deadenylation activity of this complex. Interaction between BTG2 and CCR4-NOT is needed for the antiproliferative activity of BTG2, but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated (Rouault et al. 1998, Mauxion et al. 2008, Horiuchi et al. 2009, Doidge et al. 2012, Ezzeddine et al. 2012). Two polo-like kinases, PLK2 and PLK3, are direct transcriptional targets of TP53. TP53-mediated induction of PLK2 may be important for prevention of mitotic catastrophe after spindle damage (Burns et al. 2003). PLK2 is involved in the regulation of centrosome duplication through phosphorylation of centrosome-related proteins CENPJ (Chang et al. 2010) and NPM1 (Krause and Hoffmann 2010). PLK2 is frequently transcriptionally silenced through promoter methylation in B-cell malignancies (Syed et al. 2006). Induction of PLK3 transcription by TP53 (Jen and Cheung 2005) may be important for coordination of M phase events through PLK3-mediated nuclear accumulation of CDC25C (Bahassi et al. 2004). RGCC is induced by TP53 and implicated in cell cycle regulation, possibly through its association with PLK1 (Saigusa et al. 2007). PLAGL1 (ZAC1) is a zinc finger protein directly transcriptionally induced by TP53 (Rozenfeld-Granot et al. 2002). PLAGL1 expression is frequently lost in cancer (Varrault et al. 1998) and PLAGL1 has been implicated in both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Spengler et al. 1997), but its mechanism of action remains unknown.<p>The zinc finger transcription factor ZNF385A (HZF) is a direct transcriptional target of TP53 that can form a complex with TP53 and facilitate TP53-mediated induction of CDKN1A and SFN (14-3-3 sigma) transcription (Das et al. 2007).<p>For a review of the role of TP53 in cell cycle arrest and cell cycle transcriptional targets of TP53, please refer to Riley et al. 2008, Murray-Zmijewski et al. 2008, Bieging et al. 2014, Kruiswijk et al. 2015.''',

Humans have 24 MMP genes giving rise to 23 MMP proteins, as MMP23 is encoded by two identical genes. All MMPs contain an N-terminal secretory signal peptide and a prodomain with a conserved PRCGXPD motif that in the inactive enzyme is localized with the catalytic site, the cysteine acting as a fourth unpaired ligand for the catalytic zinc atom. Activation involves delocalization of the domain containing this cysteine by a conformational change or proteolytic cleavage, a mechanism referred to as the cysteine-switch (Van Wart & Birkedal-Hansen 1990).  Most MMPs are secreted but the membrane type MT-MMPs are membrane anchored and some MMPs may act on intracellular proteins. Various domains determine substrate specificity, cell localization and activation (Hadler-Olsen et al. 2011). MMPs are regulated by transcription, cellular location (most are not activated until secreted), activating proteinases that can be other MMPs, and by metalloproteinase inhibitors such as the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). MMPs are best known for their role in the degradation and removal of ECM molecules. In addition, cleavage of the ECM and other cell surface molecules can release ECM-bound growth factors, and a number of non-ECM proteins are substrates of MMPs (Nagase et al. 2006). MMPs can be divided into subgroups based on domain structure and substrate specificity but it is clear that these are somewhat artificial, many MMPs belong to more than one functional group (Vise & Nagase 2003, Somerville et al. 2003).''',
    139958: '''The death receptors (DR), all cell-surface receptors, that belong to the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF). The term death receptor refers to those members of the TNFRSF that contain a "death domain" (DD) within their cytoplasmic tail which provides the capacity for protein–protein interactions with other DD-containing proteins suach as FADD. The main signals transmitted from TNF death receptors such as TNFR1, TRAIL-R, and CD95/FAS in response to their cognate ligand binding result in an apoptotic signaling pathway characterized by direct activation of intracellular cysteine proteases (caspases), without directly involving the mitochondrial death pathway. However, these death receptors have also been shown to initiate survival signals via the activation of transcription factors NFκappaB and AP1. This project describes an assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) downstream of TNFR1, TRAIL-R, and CD95/FAS and shows protein composition and stoichiometry within the DISC. However, the DISC signaling complex may vary in its components stoichiometry. DR signaling may trigger formation of higher order receptor structures or signaling through rearrangement of receptor chains, which is not reflected here. The project also describes neuron-type-specific signaling by the p75NTR death receptor (also known as NGFR) that can regulate a number of different biological activities in response to ligand binding, including cell death and/or survival, axonal growth and synaptic plasticity.''',

The "death receptors" are specialized cell-surface receptors including Fas/CD95, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) receptor 1, and two receptors, DR4 and DR5, that bind to the TNF-alpha related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL).  Ligand binding promotes clustering of proteins that bind to the intracellular domain of the receptor (e.g., FADD, or Fas-associated death domain-containing protein), which then binds to the prodomain of initiator caspases (e.g.caspase-8 or -10) to promote their dimerization and activation.

    2245306: '''Mucopolysaccharidosis IV A (MPS IVA, MPS4A, Morquio's syndrome, Morquio's; MIM:253000) is a rare, autosomal recessive mucopolysaccharide storage disease, first described simultaneously in 1929 by L Morquio (Morquio L, Sur une forme de distrophie familiale, Bull Soc Pediat, Paris, 27, 1929, 145-152) and JF Brailsford (Brailsford, JF, Chondro-osteo-dystrophy: roentgenographic and clinical features of child with dislocation of vertebrae,  Am j Surg, 7, 1929, 404-410). MPSIVA is caused by a deficiency in N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfatase (GALNS; MIM:612222) which normally hydrolyses 6-sulfate groups of N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfate units of chondroitin sulfate (CS) and of galactose 6-sulfate units of keratan sulfate (KS) (Matalon et al. 1974). The result is accumulation of KS/DS in cells and overexcretion in urine. Severe osteochondrodysplasia is a commonly seen phenotype for this disease. The severity of the disease is variable but severe cases limits lifespan to their 20's or 30's (Prat et al. 2008, Tomatsu et al. 2011). The gene coding for human GALNS was mapped to chromosome 16q24.3 (Masuno et al. 1993) and its structure described at the same time by two independent groups as comprising 14 exons and spanning approximately 40-50 kb (Nakashima et al.1994, Morris et al.1994).

GPCRs are also the largest class of drug targets, involved in virtually all physiological processes (Frederiksson 2003). GPCRs are receptors for a diverse range of ligands from large proteins to photons (Kristiansen et al. 2004) and have an equal diversity of ligand-binding mechanisms (Gether et al. 2002). Classical GPCR signaling involves signal transduction via heterotrimeric G-proteins, though G-protein independent mechanisms have been reported. 

Rhodopsin-like receptors (class A/1) are by far the largest group of GPCRs and the best studied, though a large proportion of the functional and structural studies have focused on a very few members; many remain functionally uncharacterized. This large family can be subdivided into at least 19 subfamilies (Subfamily A1-19) based on phylogenetic analysis (Joost & Methner 2002). Family A includes receptors for a wide variety of ligands including hormones, light and neurotransmitters, encompassing a wide range of functions including many autocrine, paracrine and endocrine processes.

The secretin-like family B/2 GPCRs includes receptors for many hormone-like peptides, such as secretin, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related peptides and vasoactive intestinal peptide, which activate adenylyl cyclase and the phosphatidyl-inositol-calcium pathway (Harmar 2001).

The class C/3 GPCRs include the metabotropic glutamate receptors and taste receptors (Brauner-Osborne et al. 2007).  All have a large extracellular N-terminus that structurally resembles a clamshell and has an important role in ligand binding.

There are two forms of recombination: non-crossover (NCO) and crossover (CO). In mammals, the former is required for correct pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes, while CO intermediates called chiasmata are required for correct segregation of bivalents.<br>Meiotic recombination is initiated by double-strand breaks created by SPO11, which remains covalently attached to the 5' ends after cleavage. SPO11 is removed by cleavage of single DNA strands adjacent to the covalent linkage. The resulting 5' ends are further resected to produce protruding 3' ends. The single-stranded 3' ends are bound by RAD51 and DMC1, homologs of RecA that catalyze a search for homology between the bound single strand and duplex DNA of the chromosomal homolog. RAD51 and DMC1 then catalyze the invasion of the single strand into the homologous duplex and the formation of a D-loop heteroduplex. Approximately 90% of heteroduplexes are resolved without crossovers (NCO), probably by synthesis-dependent strand annealing.<br>The invasive strand is extended along the homolog and ligated back to its original duplex, creating a double Holliday junction. The mismatch repair proteins MSH4, MSH5 participate in this process, possibly by stabilizing the duplexes. The mismatch repair proteins MLH1 and MLH3 are then recruited to the double Holliday structure and an unidentified resolvase (Mus81? Gen1?) cleaves the junctions to yield a crossover. <br>Crossovers are not randomly distributed: The histone methyltransferase PRDM9 recruits the recombination machinery to genetically determined hotspots in the genome and each incipient crossover somehow inhibits formation of crossovers nearby, a phenomenon called crossover interference.

    180936: '''Vpr has been implicated in multiple processes during HIV-1 replication, including nuclear import of the pre-integration complex (PIC)(Heinzinger et al., 1994), apoptosis (Stewart et al., 1997) and induction of cell cycle G2/M arrest (He et al., 1995; Re et al., 1995; Zhao et al., 1996).<br><br> Interactions between Vpr and host nucleoporins (importin) appear to facilitate the nuclear import of the PIC (Popov et al., 1998; Vodicka et al., 1998) while interactions between Vpr the adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT) protein at the inner mitochondrial membrane may contribute to release of apoptosis factors by promoting permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane (Jacotot et al., 2000). <br> <br>Vpr induces cell cycle G2/M arrest by promoting hyperphosphorylation of Cdk1/Cdc2 (Re et al., 1995; Zhao et al., 1996). However, it is unclear which protein(s) Vpr interacts with to cause this effect. For recent reviews, see, (Li et al., 2005; Zhao, Bukrinsky, and Elder, 2005). Progression of cells from G2 phase of the cell cycle to mitosis is a tightly regulated cellular process that requires activation of the Cdk1/Cdc2 kinase, which determines onset of mitosis in all eukaryotic cells. The activity of Cdk1/Cdc2 is regulated in part by the phosphorylation status of tyrosine 15 (Tyr15) on Cdk1/Cdc2, which is phosphorylated by Wee1 kinase during late G2 and is rapidly dephosphorylated by the Cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase to trigger entry into mitosis. These Cdk1/Cdc2 regulators are the downstream targets of two well-characterized G2/M checkpoint pathways which prevent cells from entering mitosis when cellular DNA is damaged or when DNA replication is inhibited. It is clear that Vpr induces cell cycle G2/M arrest by promoting Tyr15 phosphorylation of Cdk1/Cdc2 both in human and fission yeast cells (Elder et al., 2000;  Re et al., 1995; Zhao et al., 1996), which modulates host cell cycle machinery to benefit viral survival or replication. Although some aspects of Vpr-induced G2/M arrest resembles induction of host cellular checkpoints, increasing evidence suggests that Vpr induces cell cycle G2 arrest through a mechanism that is to some extent different from the classic G2/M checkpoints. One the unique features distinguishing Vpr-induced G2 arrest from the classic checkpoints is the role of phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in Vpr-induced G2 arrest (Elder, Benko, and Zhao, 2002; Elder et al., 2001; Masuda et al., 2000).  Interestingly, PP2A is targeted by a number of other viral proteins including SV40 small T antigen, polyomavirus T antigen, HTLV Tax and adenovirus E4orf4. Thus an in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Vpr-induced G2 arrest will provide additional insights into the basic biology of cell cycle G2/M regulation and into the biological significance of this effect during host-pathogen interactions.''',

    6804174: '''The most prominent TP53 target involved in G1 arrest is the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases CDKN1A (p21). CDKN1A is one of the earliest genes induced by TP53 (El-Deiry et al. 1993). CDKN1A binds and inactivates CDK2 in complex with cyclin A (CCNA) or E (CCNE), thus preventing G1/S transition (Harper et al. 1993). Considering its impact on the cell cycle outcome, CDKN1A expression levels are tightly regulated. For instance, under prolonged stress, TP53 can induce the transcription of an RNA binding protein PCBP4, which can bind and destabilize CDKN1A mRNA, thus alleviating G1 arrest and directing the affected cell towards G2 arrest and, possibly, apoptosis (Zhu and Chen 2000, Scoumanne et al. 2011). Expression of E2F7 is directly induced by TP53. E2F7 contributes to G1 cell cycle arrest by repressing transcription of E2F1, a transcription factor that promotes expression of many genes needed for G1/S transition (Aksoy et al. 2012, Carvajal et al. 2012). ARID3A is a direct transcriptional target of TP53 (Ma et al. 2003) that may promote G1 arrest by cooperating with TP53 in induction of CDKN1A transcription (Lestari et al. 2012). However, ARID3A may also promote G1/S transition by stimulating transcriptional activity of E2F1 (Suzuki et al. 1998, Peeper et al. 2002).<p>TP53 has co-factors that are key determinants of transcriptional selectivity within the p53 network. For instance, the zinc finger transcription factor ZNF385A (HZF) is a direct transcriptional target of TP53 that can form a complex with TP53 and facilitate TP53-mediated induction of CDKN1A, strongly favouring cell cycle arrest over apoptosis (Das et al. 2007).

    6804175: '''TP53 contributes to the establishment of G2 arrest by inducing transcription of GADD45A and SFN, and by inhibiting transcription of CDC25C. TP53 induces GADD45A transcription in cooperation with chromatin modifying enzymes EP300, PRMT1 and CARM1 (An et al. 2004). GADD45A binds Aurora kinase A (AURKA), inhibiting its catalytic activity and preventing AURKA-mediated G2/M transition (Shao et al. 2006, Sanchez et al. 2010). GADD45A also forms a complex with PCNA. PCNA is involved in both normal and repair DNA synthesis. The effect of GADD45 interaction with PCNA, if any, on S phase progression, G2 arrest and DNA repair is not known (Smith et al. 1994, Hall et al. 1995, Sanchez et al. 2010, Kim et al. 2013). SFN (14-3-3-sigma) is induced by TP53 (Hermeking et al. 1997) and contributes to G2 arrest by binding to the complex of CDK1 and CCNB1 (cyclin B1) and preventing its translocation to the nucleus. Phosphorylation of a number of nuclear proteins by the complex of CDK1 and CCNB1 is needed for G2/M transition (Chan et al. 1999). While promoting G2 arrest, SFN can simultaneously inhibit apoptosis by binding to BAX and preventing its translocation to mitochondria, a step involved in cytochrome C release (Samuel et al. 2001). TP53 binds the promoter of the CDC25C gene in cooperation with the transcriptional repressor E2F4 and represses CDC25C transcription, thus maintaining G2 arrest (St Clair et al. 2004, Benson et al. 2014). The zinc finger transcription factor ZNF385A (HZF) is a direct transcriptional target of TP53 that can form a complex with TP53 and facilitate TP53-mediated induction of SFN transcription (Das et al. 2007).''',

Interaction between BTG2 and CCR4-NOT is needed for the antiproliferative activity of BTG2, but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated (Rouault et al. 1998, Mauxion et al. 2008, Horiuchi et al. 2009, Doidge et al. 2012, Ezzeddine et al. 2012). Two polo-like kinases, PLK2 and PLK3, are direct transcriptional targets of TP53. TP53-mediated induction of PLK2 may be important for prevention of mitotic catastrophe after spindle damage (Burns et al. 2003). PLK2 is involved in the regulation of centrosome duplication through phosphorylation of centrosome-related proteins CENPJ (Chang et al. 2010) and NPM1 (Krause and Hoffmann 2010). PLK2 is frequently transcriptionally silenced through promoter methylation in B-cell malignancies (Syed et al. 2006). Induction of PLK3 transcription by TP53 (Jen and Cheung 2005) may be important for coordination of M phase events through PLK3-mediated nuclear accumulation of CDC25C (Bahassi et al. 2004). RGCC is induced by TP53 and implicated in cell cycle regulation, possibly through its association with PLK1 (Saigusa et al. 2007).

    201429: '''Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have many biological activities in various tissues, including bone, cartilage, blood vessels, heart, kidney, neurons, liver and lung. They are members of the Transforming growth factor-Beta (TGFB) family. They bind to type II and type I serine-threonine kinase receptors, which transduce signals through SMAD and non-SMAD signalling pathways. BMP signalling is linked to a wide variety of clinical disorders, including vascular diseases, skeletal diseases and cancer. BMPs typically activate BMP type I receptors and signal via SMAD1, 5 and 8. They can be classified into several subgroups, including the BMP2/4 group, the BMP5-8 osteogenic protein-1 (OP1) group, the growth and differentiation factor (GDF) 5-7 group and the BMP9/10 group. Most of the proteins of the BMP2/4, OP1 and BMP9/10 groups induce formation of bone and cartilage tissues in vivo, while the GDF5-7 group induce cartilage and tendon-like, but not bone-like, tissues (Miyazono et al. 2010). Members of the TGFB family bind to two types of serine-threonine kinase receptors, type I and type II (Massagué 2012). BMPs can bind type I receptors in the absence of type II receptors, but both types are required for signal transduction. The presence of both types dramatically increases binding affinity (Rozenweig et al. 1995). The type II receptor kinase transphosphorylates the type I receptor, which transmits specific intracellular signals. Type I and type II receptors share similar structural properties, comprised of a relatively short extracellular domain, a single membrane-spanning domain and an intracellular domain containing a serine-threonine kinase domain. Seven receptors, collectively referred to as the Activin receptor-like kinases (ALK), have been identified as type I receptors for the TGFB family in mammals. ALKs are classified into three groups based on their structure and function, the BMPRI group (Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-1A, ALK3, BMPR1A and Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-1B, ALK6, BMPR1B), the ALK1 group (Serine/threonine-protein kinase receptor R3, ALK1, ACVRL1 and Activin receptor type-1, ALK2, ACVR1) and the TBetaR1 group (Activin receptor type-1B, ALK4, ACVR1B and  TGF-beta receptor type-1, ALK5, TGFBR1 and Activin receptor type-1C, ALK7, ACVR1C) (Kawabata et al. 1998). ALK1 group and BMPRI group activate SMAD1/5/8 and transduce similar intracellular signals. The TBetaR1 group activate SMAD2/3. BMPR1A and ACVR1 are widely expressed. BMPR1B shows a more restricted expression profile. ACVRL1 is limited to endothelial cells and a few other cell types. The binding specificities of BMPs to type I receptors is affected by the type II receptors that are present (Yu et al. 2005). Typically, BMP2 and BMP4 bind to BMPR1A and BMPR1B (ten Dijke et al. 1994). BMP6 and BMP7 bind strongly to ACVR1 and weakly to BMPR1B. Growth/differentiation factor 5 (BMP14, GDF5) preferentially binds to BMPR1B, but not to other type I receptors (Nishitoh et al. 1995). BMP9 and BMP10 bind to ACVRL1 and ACVRL (Scharpfenecker et al. 2007). BMP type I receptors are shared by other members of the TGFB family. Three receptors, Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-2 (BMPR2), Activin receptor type-2A (ACVR2A) and Activin receptor type-2B (ACVR2B) are the type II receptors for mammalian BMPs. They are widely expressed in various tissues. BMPR2 is specific for BMPs, whereas ACVR2A and ACVR2B are shared with activins and myostatin. BMP binding and signalling can be affected by coreceptors. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family, including RGMA, RGMB (DRAGON) and Hemojuvelin (HFE2, RGMC) are coreceptors for BMP2 and BMP4, enhancing signaling (Samad et al. 2005, Babitt et al. 2005, 2006). They interact with BMP type I and/or type II receptors and bind BMP2 and BMP4, but not BMP7 or TGFB1. BMP2/4 signalling normally involves BMPR2, not ACVR2A or ACVR2B. Cells transfected with RGMA use both BMPR2 and ACVR2A for BMP-2/4 signalling, suggesting that RGMA facilitates the use of ACVR2A by BMP2/4 (Xia et al. 2007). Endoglin (ENG) is a transmembrane protein expressed in proliferating endothelial cells. It binds various ligands including TGFB1/3, Activin-A and BMP2/7 (Barbara et al. 1999). It inhibits TGFB-induced responses and enhances BMP7-induced responses (Scherner et al. 2007). Mutations in ENG result in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1), also known as OslerWeberRendu disease, while mutations in ACVRL1 lead to HHT2, suggesting that they act in a common signalling pathway (McAllister et al. 1994, Johnson et al. 1996). BMP2 is a dimeric protein, having two receptor-binding motifs. One is a high-affinity binding site for BMPR1A, the other is a low-affinity binding site for BMPR2 (Kirsch et al. 2000). In the absence of ligand stimulation, small fractions of type II and type I receptors are present as preexisting homodimers and heterodimers on the cell surface. Ligand-binding increases oligomerization. The intracellular domains of type I receptors have a characteristic GS domain (glycine and serine-rich domain) located N-terminal to the serine-threonine kinase domains. Type II receptor kinases are constitutively active in the absence of ligand. Upon ligand binding, the type II receptor kinase phosphorylates the GS domain of the type I receptor, a critical event in signal transduction by the serine/threonine kinase receptors (Miyazono et al. 2010). Activation of the TGFBR1 receptor has been studied in detail. The inactive conformation is maintained by interaction between the GS domain, the N-terminal lobe and the activation loop of the kinase (Huse et al. 1999). When the GS domain is phosphorylated by the type II receptor kinase, the TGFBR1 kinase is converted to an active conformation. Mutations of Thr-204 in TGFBR1 and the corresponding Gln in BMP type I receptors lead to their constitutive activation. The L45 loop, in the kinase domain of  type I receptors, specifically interacts with receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads). Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 3 (NT-3 growth factor receptor, TrkC, NTRK3) directly binds BMPR2, interfereing with its interaction with BMPR1A, which inhibits downstream signalling (Jin et al. 2007). Tyrosine-protein kinase transmembrane receptor ROR2 and BMPR1B form a heteromeric complex in a ligand independent fashion that modulatesGDF5-BMPR1B signalling by inhibition of Smad1/5 signalling (Sammar et al. 2004). Type I receptor kinases activated by the type II receptor kinases, phosphorylate R-Smads. R-Smads then form a complex with common-partner Smad (co-Smad) and translocate to the nucleus. The oligomeric Smad complexes regulate the transcription of target genes through interaction with various transcription factors and transcriptional coactivators or corepressors. Inhibitory Smads (I-Smads) negatively regulate the action of R-Smads and/or co-Smads. Eight different Smads have been identified in mammals. Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8 are R-Smads in BMP signalling pathways (BMP-specific R-Smads). Smad2 and Smad3 are R-Smads in TGFB/activin<br>signalling pathways. BMP receptors can phosphorylate Smad2 in certain types of cells (Murakami et al. 2009). Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8 are structurally highly similar to each other. The functional differences between them are largely unknown. Smad4 is the only co-Smad in mammals, shared by both BMP and TGFB/activin signalling pathways. Smad6 and Smad7 are I-Smads.''',
    180944: '''In order to facilitate the transport of incompletely spliced HIV-1 transcripts, Rev shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus using host cell transport mechanisms (reviewed in Li et al. 2005).  Nuclear import appears to be achieved by the association of Rev with importin-beta and B23 and docking at the nuclear pore through interactions between importin-beta and nucleoporins. The dissociation of Rev with the import machinery and the subsequent export of Rev-associated HIV-1 mRNA complex requires Ran-GTP. Ran GTP associates with importin-beta, displacing its cargo. Crm1 associates with the Rev:RNA complex and Ran:GTP and is believed to interact with nucleoporins facilitating docking of the RRE-Rev-CRM1-RanGTP complex to the nuclear pore and the translocation of the complex across the nuclear pore complex. In the cytoplasm, RanBP1 associates with Ran-GTP causing the Crm1-Rev-Ran-GTP complex to disassemble. The Ran GAP protein promotes the hydrolysis of  RanGTP to Ran GDP. The activities of Ran GAP in the cytoplasm and  Ran-GEF, which converts RAN-GDP to Ran-GTP in the nucleus, produce a gradient of Ran-GTP/GDP  required for this shuttling of Rev and other cellular transport proteins.''',

    5358330: '''Mammalian genomes encode three Hedgehog ligands, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Indian Hedgehog (IHH) and Desert Hedgehog (DHH).  These secreted morphogens can remain associated with lipid rafts on the surface of the secreting cell and affect developmental processes in adjacent cells. Alternatively, they can be released by proteolysis or packaging into vesicles or lipoprotein particles and dispersed to act on distant cells. SHH activity is required for organization of the limb bud, notochord and neural plate, IHH regulates bone and cartilage development and is partially redundant with SHH, and DHH contributes to germ cell development in the testis and formation of the peripheral nerve sheath (reviewed in Pan et al, 2013).  <br><br>Despite divergent biological roles, all Hh ligands are subject to proteolytic processing and lipid modification during transit to the surface of the secreting cell (reviewed in Gallet, 2011).

    2028285: '''Human Hippo signaling is a network of reactions that regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis, centered on a three-step kinase cascade. The cascade was discovered by analysis of Drosophila mutations that lead to tissue overgrowth, and human homologues of its components have since been identified and characterized at a molecular level. Data from studies of mice carrying knockout mutant alleles of the genes as well as from studies of somatic mutations in these genes in human tumors are consistent with the conclusion that in mammals, as in flies, the Hippo cascade is required for normal regulation of cell proliferation and defects in the pathway are associated with cell overgrowth and tumorigenesis (Oh and Irvine 2010; Pan 2010; Zhao et al. 2010). This group of reactions is also notable for its abundance of protein:protein interactions mediated by WW domains and PPxY sequence motifs (Sudol and Harvey 2010).<p>There are two human homologues of each of the three Drosophila kinases, whose functions are well conserved: expression of human proteins rescues fly mutants. The two members of each pair of human homologues have biochemically indistinguishable functions.

LATS1 and LATS2 in turn catalyze the phosphorylation of the transcriptional co-activators YAP1 and WWTR1 (TAZ) (homologues of Drosophila Yorkie).<p>In their unphosphorylated states, YAP1 and WWTR1 freely enter the nucleus and function as transcriptional co-activators.

All are of physiological interest as they are likely to be parts of mechanisms by which Hippo signaling is modulated or functionally linked to other signaling processes. First, the caspase 3 protease cleaves STK3 (MST2) and STK4 (MST1), releasing inhibitory carboxyterminal domains in each case, leading to increased kinase activity and YAP1 / TAZ phosphorylation (Lee et al. 2001). Second, cytosolic AMOT (angiomotin) proteins can bind YAP1 and WWTR1 (TAZ) in their unphosphorylated states, a process that may provide a Hippo-independent mechanism to down-regulate the activities of these proteins (Chan et al. 2011). Third, WWTR1 (TAZ) and YAP1 bind ZO-1 and 2 proteins (Remue et al. 2010; Oka et al. 2010).

    209658: '''Biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) can be summarized in five steps (reviewed in Ketting 2011, Nowotny and Yang 2009, Kim et al. 2009, Chua et al. 2009, Hannon and He 2004):<br>1. Transcription. miRNA transcripts may come from autonomously transcribed genes, they may be contained in cotranscripts with other genes, or they may be located in introns of host genes. Most miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, however a few miRNAs originate as RNA polymerase III cotranscripts with neighboring repetitive elements. The initial transcript, termed a primary microRNA (pri-miRNA), contains an imperfectly double-stranded region within a hairpin loop. Longer sequences extend from the 5' and 3' ends of the hairpin and may also contain double-stranded regions. <br>2. Cleavage by DROSHA. The 5' and 3' ends of the pri-miRNA are removed during endoribonucleolytic cleavage by the DROSHA nuclease in a complex with the RNA-binding protein DGCR8 (the Microprocessor complex). The cleavage product is a short hairpin of about 60 to 70 nt called the pre-microRNA (pre-miRNA). <br>3. Nuclear export by Exportin-5. The resulting pre-miRNA is bound by Exportin-5 in a complex with Ran and GTP. The complex translocates the pre-miRNA through the nuclear pore into the cytoplasm. <br>4. Cleavage by DICER1. Once in the cytoplasm the pre-miRNA is bound by the RISC loading complex which contains DICER1, an Argonaute protein and either TARBP2 or PRKRA. DICER1 cleaves the pre-miRNA to yield an imperfectly double-stranded miRNA of about 21 to 23 nucleotides. At this stage the double-stranded miRNA has protruding single-stranded 3' ends of 2-3 nt. <br>5. Incorporation into RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) and strand selection. The double-stranded miRNA is passed to a Argonaute protein contained in the RISC loading complex. One strand, the passenger strand, will be removed and degraded; the other strand, the guide strand, will be retained and will guide the Argonaute:miRNA complex (RISC) to target mRNAs.<br>The human genome encodes 4 Argonaute proteins (AGO1 (EIF2C1), AGO2 (EIF2C2), AGO3 (EIF2C3), AGO4 (EIF2C4)), however only AGO2 (EIF2C2) can cleave target mRNAs with perfect or nearly perfect complementarity to the guide miRNA. For complexes that contain AGO2, cleavage of the passenger strand of the double-stranded miRNA accompanies removal of the passenger strand. Complexes containing other Argonautes may use a helicase to remove the passenger strand but this is not fully known. The resulting miRNA-loaded AGO2 is predominantly located in complexes with TARBP2 or PRKRA at the cytosolic face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. AGO2, TARBP2, and DICER1 are also observed in the nucleus.''',
    6783737: '''Interleukin-10 (IL10) was originally described as a factor named cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor that  inhibited T-helper (Th) 1 activation and Th1 cytokine production (Fiorentino et al. 1989). It was found to be expressed by a variety of cell types including macrophages, dendritic cell subsets, B cells, several T-cell subpopulations including Th2 and T-regulatory cells (Tregs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells (Moore et al. 2001). It is now recognized that the biological effects of IL10 are directed at antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), its effects on T-cell development and differentiation are largely indirect via inhibition of macrophage/dendritic cell activation and maturation (Pestka et al. 2004, Mocellin et al. 2004). T cells are thought to be the main source of IL10 (Hedrich & Bream 2010). IL10 inhibits a broad spectrum of activated macrophage/monocyte functions including monokine synthesis, NO production, and expression of class II MHC and costimulatory molecules such as IL12 and CD80/CD86 (de Waal Malefyt et al. 1991, Gazzinelli et al. 1992). Studies with recombinant cytokine and neutralizing antibodies revealed pleiotropic activities of IL10 on B, T, and mast cells (de Waal Malefyt et al. 1993, Rousset et al. 1992, Thompson-Snipes et al. 1991) and provided evidence for the in vivo significance of IL10 activities (Ishida et al. 1992, 1993). IL10 antagonizes the expression of MHC class II and the co-stimulatory molecules CD80/CD86 as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1Beta, IL6, IL8, TNFalpha and especially IL12 (Fiorentino et al. 1991, D'Andrea et al. 1993). The biological role of IL10 is not limited to inactivation of APCs, it also enhances B cell, granulocyte, mast cell, and keratinocyte growth/differentiation, as well as NK-cell and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell activation (Moore et al. 2001, Hedrich & Bream 2010). IL10 also enhances NK-cell proliferation and/or production of IFN-gamma (Cai et al. 1999).  <br><br>IL10-deficient mice exhibited inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other exaggerated inflammatory responses (Kuhn et al. 1993, Berg et al. 1995) indicating a critical role for IL10 in limiting inflammatory responses. Dysregulation of IL10 is linked with susceptibility to numerous infectious and autoimmune diseases in humans and mouse models (Hedrich & Bream 2010). <br><br>IL10 signaling is initiated by binding of homodimeric IL10 to the extracellular domains of two adjoining IL10RA molecules. This tetramer then binds two IL10RB chains. IL10RB cannot bind to IL10 unless bound to IL10RA (Ding et al. 2001, Yoon et al. 2006); binding of IL10 to IL10RA without the co-presence of IL10RB fails to initiate signal transduction (Kotenko et al. 1997).<br><br>IL10 binding activates the receptor-associated Janus tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and TYK2, which are constitutively bound to IL10R1 and IL10R2 respectively. In the classic model of receptor activation assembly of the receptor complex is believed to enable JAK1/TYK2 to phosphorylate and activate each other. Alternatively the binding of IL10 may cause conformational changes that allow the pseudokinase inhibitory domain of one JAK kinase to move away from the kinase domain of the other JAK within the receptor dimer-JAK complex, allowing the two kinase domains to interact and trans-activate (Waters & Brooks 2015).<br><br>The activated JAK kinases phosphorylate the intracellular domains of the IL10R1 chains on specific tyrosine residues. These phosphorylated tyrosine residues and their flanking peptide sequences serve as temporary docking sites for the latent, cytosolic, transcription factor, STAT3. STAT3 transiently docks on the IL10R1 chain via its SH2 domain, and is in turn tyrosine phosphorylated by the receptor-associated JAKs. Once activated, it dissociates from the receptor, dimerizes with other STAT3 molecules, and translocates to the nucleus where it binds with high affinity to STAT-binding elements (SBEs) in the promoters of IL-10-inducible genes (Donnelly et al. 1999).''',

Animals however have only one direction of this bidirectional path, the synthesis of cysteine from homocysteine via cystathionine. Because excess cysteine is degraded to hydrogen sulfide, which is now known as a neuromodulator and smooth muscle relaxant, this pathway is also the main source of its production, which takes place in the cytosol, as well as in extracellular space (Dominy & Stipanuk 2004, Bearden et al. 2010).''',
    447238: '''Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a heterodimer of interleukin-12 subunit alpha (IL12A, IL-12p35) and interleukin-12 subunit beta (IL12B, IL-12p40). It is a potent immunoregulatory cytokine involved in the generation of cell mediated immunity to intracellular pathogens. It is produced by antigen presenting cells, including dendritic cells, macrophages/monocytes, neutrophils and some B cells (D'Andrea et al. 1992, Kobayashi et al.1989, Heufler et al.1996). It enhances the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells, stimulating proliferation of activated NK and T cells and induces production of interferon gamma (IFN gamma) by these cells (Stern et al. 1990). IL-12 also plays an important role in immunomodulation by promoting cell mediated immunity through induction of a class 1 T helper cell (Th1) immune response.  IL-12 may contribute to immunopathological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (McIntyre et al. 1996).
The receptor for IL-12 is a heterodimer of IL-12Rbeta1 (IL12RB1) and IL-12Rbeta2 (IL12RB2), both highly homologous to Interleukin-6 receptor subunit beta (IL6ST,gp130). Each has an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain and a cytosolic domain containing box 1 and box 2 sequences that mediate binding of Janus family tyrosine kinases (JAKs). IL-12 binding is believed to bring about the heterodimerization and generation of a high affinity receptor complex capable of signal transduction. In this model, receptor dimerization leads to juxtaposition of the cytosolic domains and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of JAK2 and TYK2. These activated kinases, in turn, tyrosine phosphorylate and activate several members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family, mainly STAT4, while also STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 have been reported to be activated (Bacon et al. 1995, Jacobson et al. 1995, Yu et al. 1996, Gollob et al.1995). The STATs translocate to the nucleus to activate transcription of several genes, including IFN gamma. The production of IFN gamma has a pleiotropic effect in the cell, stimulating production of molecules important to cell mediated immunity. In particular, IFN gamma stimulates production of more IL-12 and sets up a positive regulation loop between IL-12 signaling and IFN gamma (Chan et al. 1991). The importance of IL-12 for this loop is demonstrated by IL-12 and STAT4 knockout mice that are severely compromised in IFN-gamma production (Kaplan et al. 1996; Magram et al. 1996), as well as by patients with IL12B mutations that are severely compromised in IFN-gamma production (Altare et al.1998).''',

These interactions are mediated by a diverse set of synaptogenic proteins (Kegel et al. 2013, Siddiqui & Craig 2011). Initial synapse formation needs both the binding of secreted proteins to presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors, and the direct binding between presynaptic and postsynaptic transmembrane proteins.

Similar to other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), NTRK2 is activated by ligand binding to its extracellular domain. Ligand binding induces receptor dimerization, followed by trans-autophosphorylation of dimerized receptors on conserved tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic region. Phosphorylated tyrosines in the intracellular domain of the receptor serve as docking sites for adapter proteins, triggering downstream signaling cascaded. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NTF4, also known as NT-4) are two high affinity ligands for NTRK2. Neurotrophin-3 (NTF3, also known as NT-3), a high affinity ligand for NTRK3, binds to NTRK2 with low affinity and it is not clear if it the low level of activation of NTRK2 by NTF3 plays a physiologically relevant role.

    189232: '''Two gene families are responsible for glucose transport in humans. SLC2 (encoding GLUTs) and SLC5 (encoding SGLTs) families mediate glucose absorption in the small intestine, glucose reabsorption in the kidney, glucose uptake by the brain across the blood-brain barrier and glucose release by all cells in the body. Glucose is taken up from interstitial fluid by a passive, facilitative transport driven by the diffusion gradient of glucose (and other sugars) across the plasma membrane. This process is mediated by a family of Na+-independent, facilitative glucose transporters (GLUTs) encoded by the SLC2A gene family (Zhao & Keating 2007; Wood & Trayhurn 2003). There are 14 members belonging to this family (GLUT1-12, 14 and HMIT (H+/myo-inositol symporter)). The GLUT family can be subdivided into three subclasses (I-III) based on sequence similarity and characteristic sequence motifs (Joost & Thorens 2001).<p>Hexoses, notably fructose, glucose, and galactose, generated in the lumen of the small intestine by breakdown of dietary carbohydrate are taken up by enterocytes lining the microvilli of the small intestine and released from them into the blood. Uptake into enterocytes is mediated by two transporters localized on the lumenal surfaces of the cells, SGLT1 (glucose and galactose, together with sodium ions) and GLUT5 (fructose). GLUT2, localized on the basolateral surfaces of enterocytes, mediates the release of these hexoses into the blood (Wright et al. 2004). GLUT2 may also play a role in hexose uptake from the gut lumen into enterocytes when the lumenal content of monosaccharides is very high (Kellet & Brot-Laroche 2005) and GLUT5 mediates fructose uptake from the blood into cells of the body, notably hepatocytes.<p>Cells take up glucose by facilitated diffusion, via glucose transporters (GLUTs) associated with the plasma membrane, a reversible reaction. Four tissue-specific GLUT isoforms are known. Glucose in the cytosol is phosphorylated by tissue-specific kinases to yield glucose 6-phosphate, which cannot cross the plasma membrane because of its negative charge. In the liver, this reaction is catalyzed by glucokinase which has a low affinity for glucose (Km about 10 mM) but is not inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate. In other tissues, this reaction is catalyzed by isoforms of hexokinase. Hexokinases are feedback-inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate and have a high affinity for glucose (Km about 0.1 mM). Liver cells can thus accumulate large amounts of glucose 6-phosphate but only when blood glucose concentrations are high, while most other tissues can take up glucose even when blood glucose concentrations are low but cannot accumulate much intracellular glucose 6-phosphate. These differences are consistent with the view that that the liver functions to buffer blood glucose concentrations, while most other tissues take up glucose to meet immediate metabolic needs.<p>Glucose 6-phosphatase, expressed in liver and kidney, allows glucose 6-phosphate generated by gluconeogenesis (both tissues) and glycogen breakdown (liver) to leave the cell. The absence of glucose 6-phosphatase from other tissues makes glucose uptake by these tissues essentially irreversible, consistent with the view that cells in these tissues take up glucose for local metabolic use.<p>Class II facilitative transporters consist of GLUT5, 7, 9 and 11 (Zhao & Keating 2007, Wood & Trayhurn 2003).''',
    2216754: '''Antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as B cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes/macrophages express major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (MHC II) at their surface and present exogenous antigenic peptides to CD4+ T helper cells. CD4+ T cells play a central role in immune protection. On their activation they stimulate differentiation of B cells into antibody-producing B-cell blasts and initiate adaptive immune responses. MHC class II molecules are transmembrane glycoprotein heterodimers of alpha and beta subunits. Newly synthesized MHC II molecules present in the endoplasmic reticulum bind to a chaperone protein called invariant (Ii) chain. The binding of Ii prevents the premature binding of self antigens to the nascent MHC molecules in the ER and also guides MHC molecules to endocytic compartments. In the acidic endosomal environment, Ii is degraded in a stepwise manner, ultimately to free the class II peptide-binding groove for loading of antigenic peptides. Exogenous antigens are internalized by the APC by receptor mediated endocytosis, phagocytosis or pinocytosis into endocytic compartments of MHC class II positive cells, where engulfed antigens are degraded in a low pH environment by multiple acidic proteases, generating MHC class II epitopes. Antigenic peptides are then loaded into the class II ligand-binding groove. The resulting class II peptide complexes then move to the cell surface, where they are scanned by CD4+ T cells for specific recognition (Berger & Roche 2009, Zhou & Blum 2004, Watts 2004, Landsverk et al. 2009).''',

Both JNKs and p38-MAPK are activated in response to a variety of cellular and environmental stresses. The MAP kinases are activated by dual phosphorylation of Thr and Tyr within the  tripeptide motif Thr-Xaa-Tyr. The sequence of this tripeptide motif is different in each group of MAP kinases: ERK (Thr-Glu-Tyr); p38 (Thr-Gly-Tyr); and JNK (Thr-Pro-Tyr).<p>MAPK activation is mediated by signal transduction in the conserved three-tiered kinase cascade: MAPKKKK (MAP4K or MKKKK or MAPKKK Kinase) activates the MAPKKK. The MAPKKKs then phosphorylates a dual-specificity protein kinase MAPKK, which in turn phosphorylates the MAPK.<p>The dual specificity MAP kinase kinases (MAPKK or MKK) differ for each group of MAPK. The ERK MAP kinases are activated by the MKK1 and MKK2; the p38 MAP kinases are activated by MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6; and the JNK pathway is activated by MKK4 and MKK7. The ability of MAP kinase kinases (MKKs, or MEKs) to recognize their cognate MAPKs is facilitated by a short docking motif (the D-site) in the MKK N-terminus, which binds to a complementary region on the MAPK. MAPKs then recognize many of their targets using the same strategy, because many MAPK substrates also contain D-sites.<p>The upstream signaling events in the TLR cascade that initiate and mediate the ERK signaling pathway remain unclear.''',

    914243: '''N-linked glycosylation is the most important form of post-translational modification for proteins synthesized and folded in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (Stanley et al. 2009). An early study in 1999 revealed that about 50% of the proteins in the Swiss-Prot database at the time were N-glycosylated (Apweiler et al. 1999). It is now established that the majority of the proteins in the secretory pathway require glycosylation in order to achieve proper folding.<br>The addition of an N-glycan to a protein can have several roles (Shental-Bechor & Levy 2009). First, glycans enhance the solubility and stability of the proteins in the ER, the golgi and on the outside of the cell membrane, where the composition of the medium is strongly hydrophilic and where proteins, that are mostly hydrophobic, have difficulty folding properly. Second, N-glycans are used as signal molecules during the folding and transport process of the protein: they have the role of labels to determine when a protein must interact with a chaperon, be transported to the golgi, or targeted for degradation in case of major folding defects. Third, and most importantly, N-glycans on completely folded proteins are involved in a wide range of processes: they help determine the specificity of membrane receptors in innate immunity or in cell-to-cell interactions, they can change the properties of hormones and secreted proteins, or of the proteins in the vesicular system inside the cell.<br>All N-linked glycans are derived from a common 14-sugar oligosaccharide synthesized in the ER, which is attached co-translationally to a protein while this is being translated inside the reticulum. The process of the synthesis of this glycan, known as Synthesis of the N-glycan precursor or LLO, constitutes one of the most conserved pathways in eukaryotes, and has been also observed in some eubacteria. The attachment usually happens on an asparagine residue within the consensus sequence asparagine-X-threonine by an complex called oligosaccharyl transferase (OST).<br>After being attached to an unfolded protein, the glycan is used as a label molecule in the folding process (also known as Calnexin/Calreticulin cycle) (Lederkremer 2009). The majority of the glycoproteins in the ER require at least one glycosylated residue in order to achieve proper folding, even if it has been shown that a smaller portion of the proteins in the ER can be folded without this modification.<br>Once the glycoprotein has achieved proper folding, it is transported via the cis-Golgi through all the Golgi compartments, where the glycan is further modified according to the properties of the glycoprotein. This process involves relatively few enzymes but due to its combinatorial nature, can lead to several millions of different possible modifications. The exact topography of this network of reactions has not been established yet, representing one of the major challenges after the sequencing of the human genome (Hossler et al. 2006).<br>Since N-glycosylation is involved in an great number of different processes, from cell-cell interaction to folding control, mutations in one of the genes involved in glycan assembly and/or modification can lead to severe development problems (often affecting the central nervous system). All the diseases in genes involved in glycosylation are collectively known as Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) (Sparks et al. 2003), and classified as CDG type I for the genes in the LLO synthesis pathway, and CDG type II for the others.''',

Polyamines are essential for the growth, the maintenance and the function of normal cells. The complexity of their metabolism and the fact that polyamines homeostasis is tightly regulated support the idea that polyamines are essential to cell survival. Multiple abnormalities in the control of polyamines metabolism might be implicated in several pathological processes (Moinard et al., 2005).  Legend for the following figure:''',
    8868709: '''Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is one of a number of process that control the uptake of material from the plasma membrane, and leads to the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (Pearse et al, 1975; reviewed in Robinson, 2015; McMahon and Boucrot, 2011; Kirchhausen et al, 2014).  CME contributes to signal transduction by regulating the cell surface expression and signaling of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).  Most RTKs exhibit a robust increase in internalization rate after binding specific ligands; however, some RTKs may also exhibit significant ligand-independent internalization (reviewed in Goh and Sorkin, 2013). CME controls RTK and GPCR signaling by organizing signaling both within the plasma membrane and on endosomes (reviewed in Eichel et al, 2016; Garay et al, 2015; Vieira et al, 1996; Sorkin and von Zastrow, 2014; Di Fiori and von Zastrow, 2014; Barbieri et al, 2016). CME also contributes to the uptake of material such as metabolites, hormones and other proteins from the extracellular space, and regulates membrane composition by recycling membrane components and/or targeting them for degradation. <br><br><br>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis involves initiation of clathrin-coated pit (CCP) formation, cargo selection, coat assembly and stabilization, membrane scission and vesicle uncoating.  Although for simplicity in this pathway, the steps leading to a mature CCP are represented in a linear and temporally distinct fashion, the formation of a clathrin-coated vesicle is a highly heterogeneous process and clear temporal boundaries between these processes may not exist (see for instance Taylor et al, 2011; Antonescu et al, 2011; reviewed in Kirchhausen et al, 2014). Cargo selection in particular is a critical aspect of the formation of a mature and stable CCP, and many of the proteins involved in the initiation and maturation of a CCP contribute to cargo selection and are themselves stabilized upon incorporation of cargo into the nascent vesicle (reviewed in Kirchhausen et al, 2014; McMahon and Boucrot, 2011).<br><br><br><br>Although the clathrin triskelion was identified early as a major component of the coated vesicles, clathrin does not bind directly to membranes or to the endocytosed cargo.  Vesicle formation instead relies on many proteins and adaptors that can bind the plasma membrane and interact with cargo molecules. Cargo selection depends on the recognition of endocytic signals in cytoplasmic tails of the cargo proteins by adaptors that interact with components of the vesicle's inner coat.  The classic adaptor for clathrin-coated vesicles is the tetrameric AP-2 complex, which along with clathrin was identified early as a major component of the coat.  Some cargo indeed bind directly to AP-2, but subsequent work has revealed a large family of proteins collectively known as CLASPs (clathrin- associated sorting proteins) that mediate the recruitment of diverse cargo into the emerging clathrin-coated vesicles (reviewed in Traub and Bonifacino, 2013).  Many of these CLASP proteins themselves interact with AP-2 and clathrin, coordinating cargo recruitment with coat formation (Schmid et al, 2006; Edeling et al, 2006; reviewed in Traub and Bonifacino, 2013; Kirchhausen et al, 2014).  <br><br><br>Initiation of CCP formation is also influenced by lipid composition, regulated by clathrin-associated phosphatases and kinases (reviewed in Picas et al, 2016). The plasma membrane is enriched in PI(4,5)P2.  Many of the proteins involved in initiating clathrin-coated pit formation bind to PI(4,5)P2 and induce membrane curvature through their BAR domains (reviewed in McMahon and Boucrot, 2011; Daumke et al, 2014).  Epsin also contributes to early membrane curvature through its Epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain, which promotes membrane curvature by inserting into the lipid bilayer (Ford et al, 2002). <br><br>Following initiation, some CCPs progress to formation of vesicles, while others undergo disassembly at the cell surface without producing vesicles (Ehrlich et al, 2004; Loerke et al, 2009; Loerke et al, 2011; Aguet et al, 2013; Taylor et al, 2011). The assembly and stabilization of nascent CCPs is regulated by several proteins and lipids (Mettlen et al, 2009; Antonescu et al, 2011).<br><br><br>Maturation of the emerging clathrin-coated vesicle is accompanied by further changes in the lipid composition of the membrane and increased membrane curvature, promoted by the recruitment of N-BAR domain containing proteins (reviewed in Daumke et al, 2014; Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012; Picas et al, 2016). Some N-BAR domain containing proteins also contribute to the recruitment of the large GTPase dynamin, which is responsible for scission of the mature vesicle from the plasma membrane (Koh et al, 2007; Lundmark and Carlsson, 2003; Soulet et al, 2005; David et al, 1996; Owen et al, 1998; Shupliakov et al, 1997; Taylor et al, 2011; Ferguson et al, 2009; Aguet et al, 2013; Posor et al, 2013; Chappie et al, 2010; Shnyrova et al, 2013; reviewed in Mettlen et al, 2009; Daumke et al, 2014).  After vesicle scission, the clathrin coat is dissociated from the new vesicle by the ATPase HSPA8 (also known as HSC70) and its DNAJ cofactor auxilin, priming the vesicle for fusion with a subsequent endocytic compartment and releasing clathrin for reuse  (reviewed in McMahon and Boucrot, 2011; Sousa and Laufer, 2015).''',

MaR1 exhibits potent anti-inflammatory, pro-resolving, analgesic and wound healing activities. Major cellular targets for the actions of MaR1 are vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells and vascular endothelial cells. In these cells MaR1 attenuates the adhesion of monocytes to the endothelium induced by TNF-alpha. Maresin 1 also inhibits the production of reactive oxygen species by both VSM and endothelial cells.

Human GTSE1, similar to the mouse counterpart, binds to microtubules, shows cell cycle regulated expression with a peak in G2 and plays a role in G2 checkpoint recovery after DNA damage but is not transcriptionally regulated by TP53 (Monte et al. 2003, Monte et al. 2004, Scolz et al. 2012).<p>In G1 cells, GTSE1 is found at the microtubule lattice, likely due to direct binding to tubulin. An evolutionarily conserved interaction between GTSE1 and MAPRE1 (EB1), a microtubule plus end protein, promotes GTSE1 localization to the growing tip of the microtubules, which contributes to cell migration and is likely involved in cancer cell invasiveness. Highly invasive breast cancer cell lines exhibit high GTSE1 levels in G1, while GTSE1 levels in G1 are normally low. At the beginning of mitotic prometaphase, GTSE1 is phosphorylated by mitotic kinase(s), possibly CDK1, in proximity to the MAPRE1-binding region, causing GTSE1 dissociation from the plus end microtubule ends (Scolz et al. 2012).<p>During G2 checkpoint recovery (cell cycle re-entry after DNA damage induced G2 arrest), GTSE1 relocates to the nucleus where it binds TP53 and, in an MDM2-dependent manner, promotes TP53 cytoplasmic translocation and proteasome mediated degradation (Monte et al. 2003, Monte et al. 2004). Relocation of GTSE1 to the nucleus in G2 phase depends on PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of GTSE1 (Liu et al. 2010).<p>GTSE1-facilitated down-regulation of TP53 in G2 allows cells to avoid TP53 mediated apoptosis upon DNA damage and to re-enter cell cycle (Monte et al. 2003). While TP53 down-regulation mediated by GTSE1 in G2 correlates with decreased expression of TP53 target genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, GTSE1 can also increase the half-life of the TP53 target p21 (CDKN1A). GTSE1-mediated stabilization of CDKN1A involves interaction of GTSE1 with CDKN1A and its chaperone complex, consisting of HSP90 and FKBPL (WISp39), and may be involved in resistance to paclitaxel treatment (Bublik et al. 2010).''',

Recognition of transmembrane cargo is mediated by interaction with one of the 4 isoforms of SEC24, a component of the inner COPII coat (Miller et al, 2002; Miller et al, 2003; Mossessova et al, 2003; Mancias and Goldberg, 2008).  Soluble cargo in the ER lumen is concentrated into COPII vesicles through interaction with a receptor of the ERGIC-53 family, the p24 family or the ERV family. Each of these families of transmembrane receptors interact with cargo through their lumenal domains and with components of the COPII coat with their cytoplasmic domains and are packaged into the COPII vesicle along with the cargo.  The receptors are subsequently recycled to the ER in COPI vesicles through retrograde traffic (reviewed in Dancourt and Barlowe, 2010).  Packaging of large cargo such as fibrillar collagen depends on the transmembrane accessory factors MIA3 (also known as TANGO1) and CTAGE5.  Like the ERGIC, p24 and ERV cargo receptors, MIA3 and CTAGE5 interact both with the collagen cargo and with components of the COPII coat. Unlike the other cargo receptors, however, MIA3 and CTAGE5 are not loaded into the vesicle but remain in the ER membrane (reviewed in Malhotra and Erlmann, 2011; Malhotra et al, 2015).''',

The enzymes involved are a set of transferases which perform the transfer of the cofactor group to the substrate. The resultant conjugation results in greatly increasing the excretory potential of compounds. Although most conjugations result in pharmacological inactivation or detoxification, some can result in bioactivation. Most of the phase II enzymes are located in the cytosol except  UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT), which are microsomal.

UGTs are microsomal membrane-bound and catalyze the transfer of a glucuronate group of uridine diphosphoglucuronate (UDPGA, a co-substrate) to the functional group of specific substrates. UDPGA is synthesized from glucose-1-phosphate (G1P). G1P is required for glycolysis and is present in high concentrations in the cell, making it is unlikely to be a limiting factor in UDPGA synthesis. UDP is added to G1P to form UDP-glucose which is then dehydrogenated to form UDPGA. The basic reaction is<p><b>UDP-Glucuronate + acceptor -> UDP + acceptor-beta-D-glucuronide</b></p>The effect of this conjugation is to confer polarity to the substrate which can then be easily excreted in urine or bile.

The disease is classified here as one of glycogen storage as EPM2A (laforin) and NHLRC1 (malin) regulate normal glycogen turnover and defects in either protein are associated with the formation of Lafora bodies, accumulations of abnormal, insoluble glycogen molecules in tissues including  brain, muscle, liver, and heart (Ramachandran et al. 2009; Roach et al. 2012).

In the absence of NHLRC1 activity, EPM2A and PPP1R3C proteins appear to persist,  associated with the formation of abnormal, stable glycogen granules (Lafora bodies) (Chan et al. 2003; Gentry et al. 2005). In NHLRC1 knockout mice PPP1R3C levels are unchanged rather than increased, suggesting that NHLRC1 does not target PPP1R3C for degradation.

    70637: '''The urea cycle yields urea, the major form in which excess nitrogen is excreted from the human body, and the amino acid arginine (Brusilow and Horwich 2001). It consists of four reactions: that of ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to form citrulline, of citrulline and aspartate to form argininosuccinate, the cleavage of argininosuccinate to yield fumarate and arginine, and the cleavage of arginine to yield urea and re-form ornithine. The carbamoyl phosphate consumed in this cycle is synthesized in the mitochondria from bicarbonate and ammonia, and this synthesis in turn is dependent on the presence of N-acetylglutamate, which allosterically activates carbamoyl synthetase I enzyme. The synthesis of N-acetylglutamate is stimulated by high levels of arginine. Increased levels of free amino acids, indicated by elevated arginine levels, thus stimulate urea synthesis.<p>Two enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of arginine to yield ornithine and urea. Cytosolic ARG1 is the canonical urea cycle enzyme. Mitochondrial ARG2 likewise catalyzes urea production from arginine and may have a substantial sparing effect in patients lacking ARG1 enzyme, so its reaction is annotated here although the role of ARG2 under normal physiological conditions remains unclear.''',

The MMR proteins interact with each other to execute steps within the mismatch repair pathway. Defective variants of these proteins are associated with nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. The MutS proteins are thought to directly contact double-stranded DNA, scanning along the genomic DNA for mismatches analogous to a "sliding clamp" until they encounter a base pair containing a mismatch.

Binding of InlA to CDH1, similar to CDH1 engagement during normal cell-to-cell adhesion, triggers activation of the SRC protein tyrosine kinase and phosphorylation of CDH1 and CDH1-bound beta-catenin (CTNNB1) (Fujita et al. 2002, McLachlan et al. 2007, Sousa et al. 2007, Bonazzi et al. 2008).

Such regulation is achieved by transcriptional activation of target genes such as cyclins A, B, and E; E2F1; Diap1; and bantam microRNA.<br><br>The cadherin domain containing transmembrane protein Fat (FT) interacts with another cadherin domain containing protein Dachsous (DS).  FT inhibits the unconventional myosin, Dachs (D), by reducing its accumulation at the plasma membrane.  So, D fails to get access to and interact with the serine/threonine kinase Warts (WTS).  WTS is a key component in the Hippo kinase cassette.  In this, the active Ser/Thr kinase Hippo (HPO) homodimer interacts and activates the scaffolding protein Salvador (SAV).  This in turn recruits WTS which correspondingly recruits its the protein Mob as tumor suppressor (MATS) which activates WTS.  Active WTS recruits the transcriptional co-activator Yorkie (YKI) to this complex assembly.  YKI is phosphorylated and and binds to a 14-3-3 dimer so that it is retained in the cytosol and unable to enter the nucleus and activate it's target genes and consequently growth can be stopped.  Recently, phosphorylation-independent negative regulation of YKI has been observed.  Binding of its WW domains to PPXY sequence motifs found in HPO, WTS, and the FERM domain containing Expanded (EX) means that YKI remains in the cytosol and does not enter the nucleus to activate its target genes.<br><br>In the absence of the FT:DS interaction, D accumulates at the plasma membrane where it interacts with WTS and inhibits it.  D also reduces levels of EX at the plasma membrane.  Merlin (MER) is in its inactive phosphorylated state.  HPO homodimer, SAV, and WTS remain unphosphorylated and inactive.

    189440: '''Eight enzymes are involved in heme biosynthesis, four each in the mitochondria and the cytosol. The process starts in the mitochondria with the condensation of succinyl CoA (from the TCA cycle) and glycine to form 5-aminolevulinate (ALA). The next four steps take place in the cytosol. Two molecules of ALA are condensed to form the monopyrrole porphobilinogen (PBG). The next two steps convert four molecules of PBG into the cyclic tetrapyrrole uroporphyringen III, which is then decarboxylated into coproporphyrinogen III. The last three steps occur in the mitochondria and involve modifications to the tetrapyrrole side chains and finally, insertion of iron. In addition to these synthetic steps, a spontaneous cytosolic reaction allows the formation of uroporphyringen I which is then enzymatically decarboxylated to coproporphyrinogen I, which cannot be metabolized further in humans. Also, lead can inactivate ALAD, the enzyme that catalyzes PBG synthesis, and ferrochelatase, the enzyme that catalyzes heme synthesis.<br>The porphyrias are disorders that arise from defects in the enzymes of heme biosynthesis.

Very few foods (eg. oily fish, mushrooms exposed to sunlight and cod liver oil) are natural sources of vitamin D.  A small number of countries in the world artificially fortify a few foods with vitamin D. The metabolites of vitamin D are carried in the circulation bound to a plasma protein called vitamin D binding protein (GC) (for review see Delanghe et al. 2015, Chun 2012).

    1266733: '''Interleukin-7 (IL7) is produced primarily by T zone fibroblastic reticular cells found in lymphoid organs, and also expressed by non-hematopoietic stromal cells present in other tissues including the skin, intestine and liver. It is an essential survival factor for lymphocytes, playing a key anti-apoptotic role in T-cell development, as well as mediating peripheral T-cell maintenance and proliferation. This dual function is reflected in a dose-response relationship that distinguishes the survival function from the proliferative activity; low doses of IL7 (<1 ng/ml) sustain only survival, higher doses  (>1 ng/ml) promote survival and cell cycling (Kittipatarin et al. 2006, Swainson et al. 2007).<br><br>The IL7 receptor is a heterodimeric complex of the the common cytokine-receptor gamma chain (IL2RG, CD132, or Gc) and the IL7-receptor alpha chain (IL7R, IL7RA, CD127). Both chains are members of the type 1 cytokine family. Neither chain is unique to the IL7 receptor as IL7R is utilized by the receptor for thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) while IL2RG is shared with the receptors for IL2, IL4, IL9, IL15 and IL21. IL2RG consists of a single transmembrane region and a 240aa extracellular region that includes a fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain thought to be involved in receptor complex formation. It is expressed on most lymphocyte populations. Null mutations of IL2RG in humans cause X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID), which has a phenotype of  severely reduced T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell populations, but normal numbers of B cells. In addition to reduced T- and NK-cell numbers, Il2rg knockout mice also have dramatically reduced B-cell populations suggesting that Il2rg is more critical for B-cell development in mice than in humans. Patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) phenotype due to IL7R mutations (see Puel & Leonard 2000), or a partial deficiency of IL7R (Roifman et al. 2000) have markedly reduced circulating T cells, but normal levels of peripheral blood B cells and NK cells, similar to the phenotype of IL2RG mutations, highlighting a requirement for IL7 in T cell lymphopoiesis. It has been suggested that IL7 is essential for murine, but not human B cell development, but recent studies indicate that IL7 is essential for human B cell production from adult bone marrow and that IL7-induced expansion of the progenitor B cell compartment is increasingly critical for human B cell production during later stages of development (Parrish et al. 2009).<br><br>IL7 has been shown to induce rapid and dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of JAKs 1 and 3, and concomitantly tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA-binding activity of STAT5a/b (Foxwell et al. 1995). IL7R was shown to directly induce the activation of JAKs and STATs by van der Plas et al. (1996). Jak1 and Jak3 knockout mice displayed severely impaired thymic development, further supporting their importance in IL7 signaling (Rodig et al. 1998, Nosaka et al. 1995).<br><br>The role of STAT5 in IL7 signaling has been studied largely in mouse models. Tyr449 in the cytoplasmic domain of IL7RA is required for T-cell development in vivo and activation of JAK/STAT5 and PI3k/Akt pathways (Jiang et al. 2004, Pallard et al. 1999). T-cells from an IL7R Y449F knock-in mouse did not activate STAT5 (Osbourne et al. 2007), indicating that IL7 regulates STAT5 activity via this key tyrosine residue. STAT5 seems to enhance proliferation of multiple cell lineages in mouse models but it remains unclear whether STAT5 is required solely for survival signaling or also for the induction of proliferative activity (Kittipatarin & Khaled, 2007).<br><br>The model for IL7 receptor signaling is believed to resemble that of other Gc family cytokines, based on detailed studies of the IL2 receptor, where IL2RB binds constitutively to JAK1 while JAK3 is pre-associated uniquely with the IL2RG chain. Extending this model to IL7 suggests a similar series of events: IL7R constitutively associated with JAK1 binds IL7, the resulting trimer recruits IL2RG:JAK3, bringing JAK1 and JAK3 into proximity. The association of both chains of the IL7 receptor orients the cytoplasmic domains of the receptor chains so that their associated kinases (Janus and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases) can phosphorylate sequence elements on the cytoplasmic domains (Jiang et al. 2005). JAKs have low intrinsic enzymatic activity, but after mutual phosphorylation acquire much higher activity, leading to phosphorylation of the critical Y449 site on IL7R. This site binds STAT5 and possibly other signaling adapters, they in turn become phosphorylated by JAK1 and/or JAK3. Phosphorylated STATs translocate to the nucleus and trigger the transcriptional events of their target genes.<br><br>The role of the PI3K/AKT pathway in IL7 signaling is controversial. It is a potential T-cell survival pathway because in many cell types PI3K signaling regulates diverse cellular functions such as cell cycle progression, transcription, and metabolism. The ERK/MAPK pathway does not appear to be involved in IL7 signaling (Crawley et al. 1996).<br><br>It is not clear how IL7 influences cell proliferation. In the absence of a proliferative signal such as IL7 or IL3, dependent lymphocytes arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. To exit this phase, cells typically activate specific G1 Cyclin-dependent kinases/cyclins and down regulate cell cycle inhibitors such as Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (Cdkn1b or p27kip1). There is indirect evidence suggesting a possible role for IL7 stimulated activation of PI3K/AKT signaling, obtained from transformed cell lines and thymocytes, but not confirmed by observations using primary T-cells (Kittipatarin & Khaled, 2007). IL7 withdrawal results in G1/S cell cycle arrest and is correlated with loss of cdk2 activity (Geiselhart et al. 2001), both events which are known to be regulated by the dephosphorylating activity of Cdc25A. Expression of a p38 MAPK-resistant Cdc25A mutant in an IL-7-dependent T-cell line as well as in peripheral, primary T-cells was sufficient to sustain cell survival and promote cell cycling for several days in the absence of IL7 (Khaled et al. 2005). Cdkn1b is a member of the CIP/KIP family of cyclin-dependent cell cycle inhibitors (CKIs) that negatively regulates the G1/S transition. In IL7 dependent T-cells, the expression of Cdkn1b was sufficient to cause G1 arrest in the presence of IL7. Withdrawal of IL7 induced the upregulation of Cdkn1b and arrested cells in G1 while siRNA knockout of Cdkn1b enhanced cell cycle progression. However, adoptive transfer of Cdkn1b-deficient lymphocytes into IL7 deficient mice indicated that loss of Cdkn1b could only partially compensate for the IL7 signal needed by T-cells to expand in a lymphopenic environment (Li et al. 2006), so though Cdkn1b may be involved in negative regulation of the cell cycle through an effect on cdk2 activity, its absence is not sufficient to fully induce cell cycling under lymphopenic conditions.''',
    353327: '''Depyrimidination of a damaged nucleotide is mediated by a pyrimidine specific DNA glycosylase. The glycosylase first recognizes the damaged (or inappropriate) DNA base and then cleaves the N-C1 glycosidic bond between it and its deoxyribose sugar, generating a free base and an apyrimidinic (AP) site on the damaged strand of the DNA duplex (Lindahl and Wood 1999).''',
    177202: '''Humans, like most eukaryotic organisms, add direct repeats to the telomere using a specialized DNA polymerase called telomerase.  Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex minimally composed of a conserved protein subunit containing a reverse transcriptase domain (human telomerase reverse transcriptase, hTERT) and a template-containing RNA (human telomerase RNA component, hTERC, or hTR, hTER).  The primer for telomerase is the G-rich single-strand overhang at the chromosome end. <br><br><br>Telomerase can perform multiple rounds of repeat synthesis.  The reaction cycle has been inferred from in vitro studies of telomerase from multiple organisms and can be described as having four events: 1) DNA primer recognition, 2) RNA template alignment, 3) elongation, and 4) translocation.  Telomeric DNA is recognized in part by a presumed "anchor site" in hTERT, which preferentially binds G-rich DNA, and this interaction can affect elongation and translocation steps.  This interaction occurs 5' of the alignment of the RNA template with the end nucleotides of the chromosome.  RNA alignment positions the template adjacent to the chromosome terminus.  During elongation, the template directs sequential addition of nucleotides to the telomere end.  After synthesis of a repeat is completed, relative movement of telomerase and the primer, termed translocation, repositions telomerase at the end of the newly added sequence to allow initiation of another round of repeat addition.  <br>''',
    74803: '''Insulin binding to its receptor results in receptor autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues and the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (e.g. IRS and Shc) by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase.  This allows association of IRSs with downstream effectors such as PI-3K via its Src homology 2 (SH2) domains leading to end point events such as Glut4 (Slc2a4) translocation.  Shc when tyrosine phosphorylated associates with Grb2 and can thus activate the Ras/MAPK pathway independent of the IRSs.<p>Signal transduction by the insulin receptor is not limited to its activation at the cell surface.  The activated ligand-receptor complex initially at the cell surface, is internalised into endosomes itself a process which is dependent on tyrosine autophosphorylation.  Endocytosis of activated receptors has the dual effect of concentrating receptors within endosomes and allows the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase to phosphorylate substrates that are spatially distinct from those accessible at the plasma membrane.  Acidification of the endosomal lumen, due to the presence of proton pumps, results in dissociation of insulin from its receptor.  (The endosome constitutes the major site of insulin degradation).   This loss of the ligand-receptor complex attenuates any further insulin-driven receptor re-phosphorylation events and leads to receptor dephosphorylation by extra-lumenal endosomally-associated protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). The identity of these PTPs is not clearly established yet.''',
    169011: '''Like the mRNAs of the host cell, influenza virus mRNAs are capped and polyadenylated (reviewed in Neumann, 2004). The methylated caps, however, are scavenged from host cell mRNAs and serve as primers for viral RNA synthesis, a process termed 'cap-snatching' (Krug, 1981; Hagen, 1994). The PB2 polymerase protein binds the cap, activating endonucleolytic cleavage of the host mRNA by PB1.  The 3' poly-A tracts on viral messages are generated by polymerase stuttering on poly-U tracts near the 5' end of the template vRNA (Robertson, 1981; Zheng, 1999). The second process allows polyadenylation of viral mRNAs when the host cell polyadenylation process has been inhibited (Engelhardt, 2006; Amorim, 2006).  Notably, early transcripts (including NP and NS1) accumulate in the cytoplasm before late transcripts (M1, HA, and NS2), and in varying abundances, suggesting additional control mechanisms regulating viral gene expression (Shapiro, 1987; Hatada, 1989; Amorim, 2006).''',
    5096503: '''In response to exposure to elevated temperature and certain other proteotoxic stimuli (e.g., hypoxia, free radicals) cells activate a number of cytoprotective mechanisms known collectively as "heat shock response".  Major aspects of the heat shock response (HSR) are evolutionarily conserved events that allow cells to recover from protein damage induced by stress (Liu XD et al. 1997; Voellmy R & Boellmann F 2007;  Shamovsky I & Nudler E 2008; Anckar J & Sistonen L 2011). The main hallmark of HSR is the dramatic alteration of the gene expression pattern. A diverse group of protein genes is induced by the exposure to temperatures 3-5 degrees higher than physiological. Functionally, most of these genes are molecular chaperones that ensure proper protein folding and quality control to maintain cell proteostasis.<p>At the same time, heat shock-induced phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2alpha leads to the shutdown of the nascent polypeptide synthesis reducing the burden on the chaperone system that has to deal with the increased amount of misfolded and thermally denatured proteins (Duncan RF & Hershey JWB 1989; Sarkar A et al. 2002;  Spriggs KA et al. 2010).<p>The induction of HS gene expression primarily occurs at the level of transcription and is mediated by heat shock transcription factor HSF1(Sarge KD et al. 1993; Baler R et al. 1993). Human cells express five members of HSF protein family: HSF1, HSF2, HSF4, HSFX and HSFY. HSF1 is the master regulator of the heat inducible gene expression (Zuo J et al. 1995; Akerfelt M et al. 2010). HSF2 is activated in response to certain developmental stimuli in addition to being co-activated with HSF1 to provide promoter-specific fine-tuning of the HS response by forming heterotrimers with HSF1 (Ostling P et al. 2007; Sandqvist A et al. 2009). HSF4 lacks the transcription activation domain and acts as a repressor of certain genes during HS (Nakai A et al. 1997; Tanabe M et al. 1999; Kim SA et al. 2012). Two additional family members HSFX and HSFY, which are  located on the X and Y chromosomes respectively, remain to be characterized (Bhowmick BK et al. 2006; Shinka T et al. 2004; Kichine E et al. 2012).<p>Under normal conditions HSF1 is present in both cytoplasm and nucleus in the form of an inactive monomer. The monomeric state of HSF1 is maintained by an intricate network of protein-protein interactions that include the association with HSP90 multichaperone complex, HSP70/HSP40 chaperone machinery, as well as intramolecular interaction of two conserved hydrophobic repeat regions. Monomeric HSF1 is constitutively phosphorylated on Ser303 and Ser 307 by (Zou J et al. 1998; Knauf U et al. 1996; Kline MP & Moromoto RI 1997; Guettouche T et al. 2005). This phosphorylation plays an essential role in ensuring cytoplasmic localization of at least a subpopulation of HSF1 molecules under normal conditions (Wang X et al. 2004).<p>Exposure to heat and other proteotoxic stimuli results in the release of HSF1 from the inhibitory complex with chaperones and its subsequent trimerization, which is promoted by its interaction with translation elongation factor eEF1A1 (Baler R et al. 1993; Shamovsky I et al. 2006; Herbomel G et al 2013). The trimerization is believed to involve intermolecular interaction between hydrophobic repeats 1-3 leading to the formation of a triple coil structure. Additional stabilization of the HSF1 trimer is provided by the formation of intermolecular S-S bonds between Cys residues in the DNA binding domain (Lu M et al.2008). Trimeric HSF1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus where it binds the specific sequence in the promoter of hsp genes (Sarge KD et al. 1993; Wang Y and Morgan WD 1994). The binding sequence for HSF1 (HSE, heat shock element) contains series of inverted repeats nGAAn in head-to-tail orientation, with at least three elements being required for the high affinity binding. Binding of the HSF1 trimer to the promoter is not sufficient to induce transcription of the gene (Cotto J et al. 1996). In order to do so, HSF1 needs to undergo inducible phosphorylation on specific Ser residues such as Ser230, Ser326. This phosphorylated form of HSF1 trimer is capable of increasing the promoter initiation rate. HSF1 bound to DNA promotes recruiting components of the transcription mediator complex and  relieving promoter-proximal pause of RNA polymerase II through its interaction with TFIIH transcription factor (Yuan CX & Gurley WB 2000).<p>HSF1 activation is regulated in a precise and tight manner at multiple levels (Zuo J et al. 1995; Cotto J et al. 1996). This allows fast and robust activation of HS response to minimize proteotoxic effects of the stress. The exact set of HSF1 inducible genes is probably cell type specific. Moreover, cells in different pathophysiological states will display different but overlapping profile of HS inducible genes.''',
    140346: '''Activation of phospholipase C enzymes results in the generation of second messengers of the phosphatidylinositol pathway. The events resulting from this pathway are a rise in intracellular calcium and activation of Protein Kinase C (PKC). Phospholipase C cleaves the phosphodiester bond in PIP2 to form 1,2 Diacylglycerol (DAG) and 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 opens Ca2+ channels in the platelet dense tubular system, raising intracellular Ca2+ levels. DAG is a second messenger that regulates a family of Ser/Thr kinases consisting of PKC isozymes (Nishizuka 1995). DAG achieves activation of PKC isozymes by increasing their affinity for phospholipid. Most PKC enzymes are also calcium-dependent, so their activation is in synergy with the rise in intracellular Ca2+. Platelets contain several PKC isoforms that can be activated by DAG and/or Ca2+ (Chang 1997).''',
    140347: '''Initiation of platelet adhesion is the first step in the formation of the platelet plug. Circulating platelets are arrested and subsequently activated by exposed collagen and vWF. It is not entirely clear which type of collagen is responsible for adhesion and activation; collagen types I and III are abundant in vascular epithelia but several other types incluing IV are present (Farndale 2006). Several collagen binding proteins are expressed on platelets, including integrin alpha2 beta1, GPVI, and GPIV. Integrin alpha2 beta1, known on leukocytes as VLA-2, is the major platelet collagen receptor (Kunicki et al. 1988). It requires Mg2+ to interact with collagen and may require initiation mediated by the activation of integrin alphaIIb beta3 (van de Walle 2007). Binding occurs via the alpha2 subunit I domain to a collagen motif with the sequence Gly-Phe-Hyp-Gly-Glu-Arg (Emsley 2000). Binding of collagen to alpha2 beta1 generates intracellular signals that contribute to platelet activation. These facilitate the engagement of the lower-affinity collagen receptor, GPVI (Keely 1996), the key receptor involved in collagen-induced platelet activation. The GPVI receptor is a complex of the GPVI protein with a dimer of Fc epsilon R1 gamma (FceRI gamma). The Src family kinases Fyn and Lyn constitutively associate with the GPVI:FceRIgamma complex in platelets and initiate platelet activation through phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in FceRI gamma, leading to binding and activation of the tyrosine kinase Syk. Downstream of Syk, a series of adapter molecules and effectors lead to platelet activation. vWF  protein is a polymeric structure of variable size. It is secreted in two directions, by the endothelium basolaterally and into the bloodstream. Shear-induced aggregation is achieved when vWF binds via its A1 domain to GPIb (part of GPIb-IX-V), and via its A3 domain mediating collagen binding to the subendothelium. The interaction between vWF and GPIb is regulated by shear force; an increase in the shear stress results in a corresponding increase in the affinity of vWF for GPIb.''',
    5665852: '''Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) acts as a buffer against starvation by liberating building materials and energy sources from cellular components. It has additional roles in embryonic development, removal of apoptotic cells or organelles, antigen presentation, protection against toxins and as a degradation route for aggregate-prone proteins and infectious agents. The dysregulation of autophagy is involved in several human diseases, for example, Crohn's disease, cancer and neurodegeneration (Ravikumar et al. 2010).<br>Autophagy is highly conserved from yeast to humans; much of the machinery was first identified in yeast (see Klionsky et al. 2011). Initially, double-membraned cup-shaped structures called the isolation membrane or phagophore engulf portions of cytoplasm. The membranes fuse to form the autophagosome. In yeast cells, autophagosomes are formed at the phagophore assembly site (PAS) next to the vacuole. In mammals, autophagosomes appear throughout the cytoplasm then move along microtubules towards the microtubule-organising centre. This transport requires microtubules and the function of dynein motor proteins; depolymerization of microtubules or inhibition of dynein-dependent transport results in inhibition of autophagy (Kochl et al. 2006, Kimura et al. 2008). Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes forming autolysosomes whose contents are degraded by lysosomal hydrolases (Mizushima et al. 2011).<br><br>The origins of the autophagosomal membrane and the  incorporation of existing membrane material have been extensively debated. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs), the Golgi, the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes have all been implicated in the nucleation of the isolation membrane and subsequent growth of the membrane (Lamb et al. 2013). Recently 3D tomographic imaging of isolation membranes has shown the cup-shaped isolation membrane tightly sandwiched between two sheets of ER and physically connected to the ER through a narrow membrane tube (Hayashi-Nishino et al. 2009, Yla-Anttila et al. 2009). This suggests that isolation membrane formation and elongation are guided by adjacent ER sheets, supporting the now prevalent 'ER cradle' model, which suggests that the isolation membrane arises from the ER (Hayashi-Nishino et al. 2009, Shibutani & Yoshimori 2014).<br><br>Autophagy is tightly regulated. The induction of autophagy in response to starvation is partly mediated by inactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (Noda & Ohsumi 1998) and activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), while energy loss induces autophagy by activation of AMP kinase (AMPK). Other pathways regulating autophagy are regulated by calcium, cyclic AMP, calpains and the inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (Rubinsztein et al. 2012). <br><br>In mammals, two complexes cooperatively produce the isolation membrane. The ULK complex consists of ULK1/2, ATG13, (FIP200) and ATG101 (Alers et al. 2012). The PIK3C3-containing Beclin-1 complex consists of PIK3C3 (Vps34), BECN1 (Beclin-1, Atg6), PIK3R4 (p150, Vps15) and ATG14 (Barkor) (Matsunaga et al. 2009, Zhong et al. 2009). A similar complex where ATG14 is replaced by UVRAG functions later in autophagosome maturation and endocytic traffic (Itakura et al. 2008, Liang et al. 2008). Binding of KIAA0226 to this complex negatively regulates the maturation process (Matsunaga et al. 2009). The ULK and Beclin-1 complexes are recruited to specific autophagosome nucleation regions where they stimulate phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) production and facilitate the elongation and initial membrane curvature of the phagophore membrane (Carlsson & Simonsen 2015).<br><br>The ULK complex is considered the most upstream component of the mammalian autophagy pathway (Itakura & Mizushima 2010), acting as an integrator of the autophagy signals downstream of mTORC1. It is not fully understood how ULK1 is modulated in response to environmental cues. Phosphorylation plays an essential role (Dunlop & Tee 2013) but it is not clear how phosphorylation regulates ULK1 activities (Ravikumar et al. 2010). ULK1 kinase activity is required for autophagy, but the substrate(s) of ULK1 that mediate its autophagic function are not certain. ULK1 may also have kinase-independent functions in autophagy (Wong et al. 2013). <br><br> PIK3C3 (Vps34) is a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase that produces PI3P. It is essential for the early stages of autophagy and colocalizes strongly with early autophagosome markers (Axe et al. 2008). BECN1 binds several further proteins that affect autophagosome formation. Partners that induce autophagy include AMBRA1 (Fimia et al. 2007), UVRAG (Liang et al. 2006) and SH3GLB1 (Takahashi et al. 2007). Binding of BCL2 or BCL2L1 (Bcl-xL) inhibit autophagy (Pattingre et al. 2005, Ciechomska et al. 2009). The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor complex that binds BCL2 also interacts with BECN1, inhibiting autophagy (Vincencio et al. 2009). CISD2 (Nutrient-deprivation autophagy factor-1, NAF1), a component in the IP3R complex, interacts with BCL2 at the ER and stabilizes the BCL2-BECN1 interaction (Chang et al. 2010). Starvation leads to activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-1 (JNK1), which results in the phosphorylation of BCL2 and BCL2L1, which release their binding to BECN1 and thus induces autophagosome formation (Wei et al. 2008). <br><br>AMBRA1 can simultaneously bind dynein and the Beclin-1 complex.  During nutrient starvation, AMBRA1 is phosphorylated in a ULK1-dependent manner (Di Bartolomeo et al. 2010). This phosphorylation releases AMBRA1-associated Beclin-1 complexes from dynein and the microtubule network, freeing the complex to translocate to autophagy initiation sites (Di Bartolomeo et al. 2010). <br><br>A characteristic of this early phase of autophagosome formation is the formation of PI3P-enriched ER-associated structures called omegasomes (Axe et al. 2008) or cradles (Hayashi-Nishino et al. 2009). Omegasomes appear to concentrate at or near the connected mitochondria-associated ER membrane (Hamasaki et al. 2013). However, the phagophore also can incorporate existing material from other membrane sources such as ER exit sites (ERES), the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), the Golgi, the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes (Carlsson & Simonsen 2015). Omegasomes lead to the formation of the isolation membrane or phagophore, which is thought to form de novo by an unknown mechanism (Simonsen & Stenmark 2008, Roberts & Ktistakis 2013). Phagophore expansion is probably mediated by membrane uptake from endomembranes and semi-autonomous organelles (Lamb et al. 2013, Shibutani & Yoshimori 2014).<br><br>ATG9 is a direct target of ULK1. In nutrient-rich conditions mammalian ATG9 is localized to the trans-Golgi network and endosomes (including early, late and recycling endosomes), whereas under starvation conditions it is localized to autophagosomes, in a process that is dependent on ULK1 (Young et al. 2006). ATG9 is believed to play a role in the delivery of vesicles derived from existing membranes to the expanding phagophore (Lamb et al. 2013). Yeast Atg9 forms a complex with Atg2 and Atg18 (Reggiori et al. 2004). <br><br>PI3P produced at the initiation site is sensed by WIPI2b, the mammalian homologue of Atg18 (Polson et al. 2010). WIPI2b then recruits Atg16L1 (Dooley et al. 2014). There are four WIPI proteins in mammalian cells (Proikas-Cezanne et al. 2015). They are all likely bind PI3P and be recruited to membranes but the function of WIPI1, 3 and 4 in autophagy is not yet clear. WIPI4 (WDR45) has been shown to bind Atg2 and to be involved in lipid droplet formation (Velikkakath et al. 2012); mutations in WIPI4 have been shown to cause a neurodegenerative disease (Saitsu et al. 2013).<br><br>The elongation of the membrane that will become the autophagosome is regulated by two ubiquitination-like reactions. First, the ubiquitin-like molecule ATG12 is conjugated to ATG5 by ATG7, which acts as an E1-like activating enzyme, and ATG10, which has a role similar to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The ATG5:ATG12 complex then interacts non-covalently with ATG16L1. This complex associates with the forming autophagosome but dissociates from completed autophagosomes (Geng & Klionski 2008). The second ubiquitin-like reaction involves the conjugation of ubiquitin-like molecules of the LC3 family (Weidberg et al. 2010). LC3 proteins are conjugated through their C-terminal glycine residues with PE by the E1-like ATG7 and E2-like ATG3. This allows LC3 proteins to associate with the autophagosome membrane. <br><br>The ATG12:ATG5:ATG16L1 complex (Mizushima et al., 2011) acts as an E3 like enzyme for the conjugation of LC3 family proteins (mammalian homologues of yeast Atg8) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (Hanada et al. 2007, Fujita et al. 2008). LC3 PE can be deconjugated by the protease ATG4 (Li et al. 2011, 2012). ATG4 is also responsible for priming LC3 proteins by cleaving the C terminus to expose a glycine residue (Kirisako et al, 2000, Scherz Shouval et al. 2007). LC3 proteins remain associated with autophagosomes until they fuse with lysosomes. The LC3-like proteins inside the resulting autolysosomes are degraded, while those on the cytoplasmic surface are delipidated and recycled. ATG5:ATG12:ATG16L1-positive LC3-negative vesicles represent pre-autophagosomal structures (pre-phagophores and possibly early phagophores), ATG5:ATG12:ATG16L1-positive LC3-positive structures can be considered to be phagophores, and ATG5:ATG12:ATG16L1-negative LC3-positive vesicles can be regarded as mature autophagosomes (Tandia et al. 2011).<br><br>Phagophore expansion is probably mediated by membrane uptake from endomembranes as well as from semiautonomous organelles (Lamb et al. 2013, Shibutani & Yoshimori 2014).<br><br>The mechanisms involved in the closure of the phagophore membrane are poorly understood. As the phagophore is a double-membraned structure, its closure involves the fusion of a narrow opening, a process that is distinct from other membrane fusion events (Carlsson & Simonsen 2015). The topology of the phagophore is similar to that of cytokinesis, viral budding or multivesicular body (MVB) formation. These processes rely on the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) (Rusten et al. 2012). ESCRT and associated proteins facilitate membrane budding away from the cytosol and subsequent cleavage of the bud neck (Hurley & Hanson 2010). Several studies have shown that depletion of ESCRT subunits or the regulatory ATPase Vps4 causes an accumulation of autophagosomes (Filimonenko et al. 2007, Rusten et al. 2007) but it is not clear whether ESCRTs are required for autophagosome closure or for autophagosome to endosome fusion. UVRAG is also involved in the maturation step, recruiting proteins that bring about membrane fusion such as the class C Vps proteins, which activate Rab7 thereby promoting fusion with late endosomes and lysosomes (Liang et al. 2008).''',
    169021: '''The viral RNP complex is exported from the nucleus via the host cell CRM1 export pathway (Fukuda, 1997; Neumann, 2000; reviewed in Buolo, 2006). The vRNP complex does not interact directly with CRM1 to form an export complex. Rather, an additional viral protein, nuclear export protein (NEP/NS2), acts as an adaptor, binding the viral matrix M1 protein and CRM1, thus linking the viral RNP with CRM1 (Martin, 1991; O'Neill, 1998; Neumann, 2000; Akarsu, 2003).  The CRM1/exportin-1 complex recruits additional host cell proteins, and traverses the nuclear pore into the cytosol.''',
    140348: '''Platelet activation begins with the initial binding of adhesive ligands and of the excitatory platelet agonists (released or generated at the sites of vascular trauma) to cognate receptors on the platelet membrane (Ruggeri 2002). Intracellular signaling reactions then enhance the adhesive and procoagulant properties of tethered platelets or of platelets circulating in the proximity. Once platelets have adhered they degranulate, releasing stored secondary agents such as ADP, ATP, and synthesize thromboxane A2. These amplify the response, activating and recruiting further platelets to the area and promoting platelet aggregation. These amplify the response, activating and recruiting further platelets to the area and promoting platelet aggregation. Adenosine nucleotides signal through P2 purinergic receptors on the platelet membrane. ADP activates P2Y1 and P2Y12, which signal via  both the alpha and gamma:beta components of the heterotrimeric G-protein (Hirsch et al. 2001, 2006),
while ATP activates the ionotropic P2X1 receptor (Kunapuli et al. 2003). Activation of these receptors initiates a complex signaling cascade that ultimately results in platelet activation, aggregation and thrombus formation (Kahner et al. 2006).

Integrin AlphaIIbBeta3 is the most abundant platelet receptor, with 40 000 to 80 000 copies per resting platelet, acting as a major receptor for fibrinogen and other adhesive molecules (Wagner et al. 1996). Activation of AlphaIIbBeta3 enhances adhesion and leads to platelet-platelet interactions, and thus aggregation (Philips et al. 1991). GP VI is the most potent collagen receptor initiating signal generation, an ability derived from its interaction with the FcRI gamma chain. This results in the phosphorylation of the gamma-chain by non-receptor tyrosine kinases of the Src family (1). The phosphotyrosine motif is recognized by the SH2 domains of Syk, a tyrosine kinase. This association activates the Syk enzyme, leading to activation (by tyrosine phosphorylation) of PLC gamma2 (2). Thrombin is an important platelet agonist generated on the membrane of stimulated platelets. Thrombin acts via cell surface Protease Activated Receptors (PARs). PARs are G-protein coupled receptors activated by a proteolytic cleavage in an extracellular loop (Vu, 1991) (3). Activated PARs signal via G alpha q (4) and via the beta:gamma component of the G-protein (5). Both stimulate PLC giving rise to PIP2 hydrolysis and consequent activation of PI3K (6). PLCgamma2 activation also gives rise to IP3 (7) which stimulates the IP3 receptor (8) leading to increased intracellular calcium. Platelet activation further results in the scramblase-mediated transport of negatively-charged phospholipids to the platelet surface. These phospholipids provide a catalytic surface (with the charge provided by phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine) for the tenase complex (formed by the activated forms of the blood coagulation factors factor VIII and factor I).''',

    5653569: '''Fructose is found in fruits, is one of the components of the disaccharide sucrose, and is a widely used sweetener in processed foods. Dietary fructose is catabolized in the liver via fructose 1-phosphate to yield dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which then are converted to pyruvate via steps of canonical glycolysis (Hers & Kusaka 1953; Sillero et al. 1969). Excessive dietary intake of fructose and its metabolism have been associated with major disease risks in humans, although this issue remains controversial (Kolderup & Svihus 2015; DiNicolantonio et al. 2015; Bray 2013; Mayes 1993; Rippe & Angelopoulos 2013; van Buul et al. 2013).

    5633091: '''While the p53 tumor suppressor protein (TP53) is known to inhibit cell growth by inducing apoptosis, senescence and cell cycle arrest, recent studies have found that p53 is also able to influence cell metabolism to prevent tumor development. TP53 regulates transcription of many genes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, nucleotides and amino acids, protein synthesis and aerobic respiration.<p>TP53 stimulates transcription of TIGAR, a D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase. TIGAR activity decreases glycolytic rate and lowers ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels in cells (Bensaad et al. 2006). TP53 may also negatively regulate the rate of glycolysis by inhibiting the expression of glucose transporters GLUT1, GLUT3 and GLUT4 (Kondoh et al. 2005, Schwartzenberg-Bar-Yoseph et al. 2004, Kawauchi et al. 2008).<p>TP53 negatively regulates several key points in PI3K/AKT signaling and downstream mTOR signaling, decreasing the rate of protein synthesis and, hence, cellular growth. TP53 directly stimulates transcription of the tumor suppressor PTEN, which acts to inhibit PI3K-mediated activation of AKT (Stambolic et al. 2001). TP53 stimulates transcription of sestrin genes, SESN1, SESN2, and SESN3 (Velasco-Miguel et al. 1999, Budanov et al. 2002, Brynczka et al. 2007). One of sestrin functions may be to reduce and reactivate overoxidized peroxiredoxin PRDX1, thereby reducing ROS levels (Budanov et al. 2004, Papadia et al. 2008, Essler et al. 2009). Another function of sestrins is to bind the activated AMPK complex and protect it from AKT-mediated inactivation. By enhancing AMPK activity, sestrins negatively regulate mTOR signaling (Budanov and Karin 2008, Cam et al. 2014). The expression of DDIT4 (REDD1), another negative regulator of mTOR signaling, is directly stimulated by TP63 and TP53. DDIT4 prevents AKT-mediated inactivation of TSC1:TSC2 complex, thus inhibiting mTOR cascade (Cam et al. 2014, Ellisen et al. 2002, DeYoung et al. 2008). TP53 may also be involved, directly or indirectly, in regulation of expression of other participants of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, such as PIK3CA (Singh et al. 2002), TSC2 and AMPKB (Feng et al. 2007). <p>TP53 regulates mitochondrial metabolism through several routes. TP53 stimulates transcription of SCO2 gene, which encodes a mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein (Matoba et al. 2006). TP53 stimulates transcription of RRM2B gene, which encodes a subunit of the ribonucleotide reductase complex, responsible for the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides and essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA content in the cell (Tanaka et al. 2000, Bourdon et al. 2007, Kulawiec et al. 2009). TP53 also transactivates mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), a nuclear-encoded gene important for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcription and maintenance (Park et al. 2009). Finally, TP53 stimulates transcription of the mitochondrial glutaminase GLS2, leading to increased mitochondrial respiration rate and reduced ROS levels (Hu et al. 2010). <p>The great majority of tumor cells generate energy through aerobic glycolysis, rather than the much more efficient aerobic mitochondrial respiration, and this metabolic change is known as the Warburg effect (Warburg 1956). Since the majority of tumor cells have impaired TP53 function, and TP53 regulates a number of genes involved in glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, it is likely that TP53 inactivation plays an important role in the metabolic derangement of cancer cells such as the Warburg effect and the concomitant increased tumorigenicity (reviewed by Feng and Levine 2010). On the other hand, some mutations of TP53 in Li-Fraumeni syndrome may result in the retention of its wild-type metabolic activities while losing cell cycle and apoptosis functions (Wang et al. 2013). Consistent with such human data, some mutations of p53, unlike p53 null state, retain the ability to regulate energy metabolism while being inactive in regulating its classic gene targets involved in cell cycle, apoptosis and senescence. Retention of metabolic and antioxidant functions of p53 protects p53 mutant mice from early onset tumorigenesis (Li et al. 2012). ''',

    1307730: '''A human mitochondrion contains about 1500 proteins, more than 99% of which are encoded in the nucleus, synthesized in the cytosol and imported into the mitochondrion. Proteins are targeted to four locations (outer membrane, intermembrane space, inner membrane, and matrix) and must be sorted accordingly (reviewed in Kutik et al. 2007, Milenkovic et al. 2007, Bolender et al. 2008, Endo and Yamano 2009, Wiedemann and Pfanner 2017, Kang et al. 2018). Newly synthesized proteins are transported from the cytosol across the outer membrane by the TOMM40:TOMM70 complex. Proteins that contain presequences first interact with the TOMM20 subunit of the complex while proteins that contain internal targeting elements first interact with the TOMM70 subunit. After initial interaction the protein is conducted across the outer membrane by TOMM40 subunits. In yeast some proteins such as Aco1, Atp1, Cit1, Idh1, and Atp2 have both presequences that interact with TOM20 and mature regions that interact with TOM70 (Yamamoto et al. 2009).<br>After passage across the outer membrane, proteins may be targeted to the outer membrane via the SAMM50 complex, to the inner membrane via the TIMM22 or TIMM23 complexes (reviewed in van der Laan et al. 2010), to the matrix via the TIMM23 complex (reviewed in van der Laan et al. 2010), or proteins may fold and remain in the intermembrane space (reviewed in Stojanovski et al. 2008, Deponte and Hell 2009,  Sideris and Tokatlidis 2010).

Most ubiquinone is naturally reduced to ubiquinol (Q10H2 in humans) and it is this form which dominates in most human tissues.  It functions as an ubiquitous coenzyme in redox reactions and its ability both to associate with complexes I and III of the electron transport chain and to move freely in the inner mitochondrial membrane are central to its role in electron transport.  In eukaryotes ubiquinones/ubiquinols are also found in other membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi vesicles, lysosomes and peroxisomes.<br><br>Ubiquinol/ubiquinone is synthesized in the following way.  Initially, the polyisoprenoid tail is assembled by a polyprenyl diphosphate synthase.  Next, 4 hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase (COQ2) catalyses the formation of the covalent linkage between the benzoquinone head group and the tail to produce 4 hydroxy 3 polyprenyl benzoic acid intermediate (DHB, 3 decaprenyl 4 hydroxybenzoic acid in humans).  There follows modifications of the aromatic ring starting with hydroxylation, followed by O methylation, and decarboxylation to form the 2 methoxy 6 polyprenyl phenol intermediate (DMPhOH ; 2 methoxy 6 decaprenylphenol in humans).  Following this, two additional methylations, one C methylation, and one O methylation step, finally generate the fully substituted hydroquinone, ubiquinol (Szkopinska 2000, Kagan & Quinn 2000, Tran & Clarke 2007, Kawamukai 2009).

Abnormally long 3' UTRs may prevent PABP from efficiently interacting with eRF3 and allow UPF1 to bind eRF3 instead.

    140375: '''The intrinsic (Bcl-2 inhibitable or mitochondrial) pathway of apoptosis functions in response to various types of intracellular stress including growth factor withdrawal, DNA damage, unfolding stresses in the endoplasmic reticulum and death receptor stimulation. Following the reception of stress signals, proapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins are activated and subsequently interact with and inactivate antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins. This interaction leads to the destabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and release of apoptotic factors.  These factors induce the caspase proteolytic cascade, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation, ultimately leading to cell death. The key players in the Intrinsic pathway are the Bcl-2 family of proteins that are critical death regulators residing immediately upstream of mitochondria. The Bcl-2 family consists of both anti- and proapoptotic members that possess conserved alpha-helices with sequence conservation clustered in BCL-2 Homology (BH) domains. Proapoptotic members are organized as follows: <p> 1. "Multidomain" BAX family proteins such as BAX, BAK etc. that display sequence conservation in their BH1-3 regions.

EJCs contain the core factors eIF4A-III, Magoh-Y14, and CASC3 as well as the peripheral factors RNPS1, UPF2, and UPF3. UPF2 and UPF3  recruit UPF1 to eRF3 at the terminating ribosome. Thus an EJC downstream of a termination codon will not have been dislodged during translation and will recruit UPF1, triggering NMD.<br>UPF1 is believed to form a complex containing SMG1, SMG8, and SMG9. In the key regulatory step of NMD SMG1 phosphorylates UPF1. The phosphorylated UPF1 then recruits either SMG6 or SMG5 and SMG7. SMG6 is itself an endoribonuclease that cleaves the mRNA. SMG5 and SMG7 do not have endoribonuclease activty, but are thought to recruit ribonucleases. Nonsense-mediated decay has been observed to involve deadenlyation, decapping, and both 5' to 3' and 3' to 5' exonuclease activities, but the exact degradative pathways taken by a given mRNA are not yet known.<br>UPF1 also plays roles in Staufen-mediated decay, histone mRNA decay, telomere maintenance, genome integrity, and may play a role in normal termination of translation.''',
    451674: '''The IL-1 family of cytokines that interact with the Type 1 IL-1R include IL-1α (IL1A), IL-1β (IL1B) and the IL-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL1RAP). IL1RAP is synthesized with a signal peptide and secreted as a mature protein via the classical secretory pathway.  IL1A and IL1B are synthesised as cytoplasmic precursors (pro-IL1A and pro-IL1B) in activated cells. They have no signal sequence, precluding secretion via the classical ER-Golgi route (Rubartelli et al. 1990). Processing of pro-IL1B to the active form requires caspase-1 (Thornberry et al. 1992), which is itself activated by a molecular scaffold termed the inflammasome (Martinon et al. 2002). Processing and release of IL1B are thought to be closely linked, because mature IL1B is only seen inside inflammatory cells just prior to release (Brough et al. 2003). It has been reported that in monocytes a fraction of cellular IL1B is released by the regulated secretion of late endosomes and early lysosomes, and that this may represent a cellular compartment where caspase-1 processing of pro-IL1B takes place (Andrei et al. 1999). Shedding of microvesicles from the plasma membrane has also been proposed as a mechanism of secretion (MacKenzie et al. 2001). These proposals superceded previous models in which non-specific release due to cell lysis and passage through a plasma membrane pore were considered. However, there is evidence in the literature that supports all of these mechanisms and there is still controversy over how IL1B exits from cells (Brough & Rothwell 2007).

It serves as a template for the synthesis of new vRNA molecules, which in turn serve as a template for mRNA particularly early in infection, and cRNA.

Hh-Np tethered in this way may cluster in sterol-rich lipid rafts where it is competent for short-range signaling.  Cell surface Hh-Np also interacts with glypican components of the extracellular matrix and this interaction stabilizes the ligand and is required for its lateral spread.  Together, clustering into lipid rafts and interaction with HSPGs may favour packaging of ligand into higher order forms required for ligand dispersal.<br> Long-range signaling requires release of Hh-Np from the secreting cell.

    435302: '''G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are classically defined as the receptor, G-protein and downstream effectors, the alpha subunit of the G-protein being the primary signaling molecule. However, it has become clear that this greatly oversimplifies the complexities of GPCR signaling (Gurevich & Gurevich 2008). The beta:gamma G-protein dimer is also involved in downstream signaling (Smrcka 2008) and some receptors form metastable complexes with accessory proteins such as the arrestins. 

GPCRs are involved in many diverse signaling events (Kristiansen 2004), using a variety of pathways that include modulation of adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK. Regulator of G-protein Signalling (RGS) proteins can directly inhibit the activity of the G-alpha subunit (Soundararajan et al. 2008).

The general function of the G alpha-s subunit (Gs) is to activate adenylate cyclase (Tesmer et al. 1997), which in turn produces cyclic-AMP (cAMP), leading to the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinases (often referred to collectively as Protein Kinase A). The signal from the ligand-stimulated GPCR is amplified because the receptor can activate several Gs heterotrimers before it is inactivated. 

The classical signalling mechanism for G alpha-i (Gi) is inhibition of the cAMP dependent pathway through inhibition of adenylate cyclase (Dessauer et al. 2002). Decreased production of cAMP results in decreased activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinases. 

G alpha-z (Gz) is a member of the Gi family. Unlike other Gi family members it is pertussis toxin-insensitive. Gz interacts with Rap1 GTPase activating protein (RAP1GAP) to attenuate Rap1 signaling.

The classic signalling route for G alpha-q (Gq) is activation of phospholipase C beta, leading to phosphoinositide hydrolysis, calcium mobilization and protein kinase C activation. This provides a path to calcium-regulated kinases and phosphatases, GEFs, MAP kinases and many other proteins.

The G-alpha-12/13 (G12/13) family is probably the least well characterized, at least in part because G12/13 coupling is more difficult to determine than for other subtypes, G12/13 is best known for involvement in the processes of cell proliferation and morphology, such as stress fiber and focal adhesion formation. Interactions with Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs)  are thought to mediate many of these processes. (Buhl et al.1995, Sugimoto et al. 2003). Activation of Rho or the regulation of events through Rho is often taken as evidence of G12/13 signaling. Receptors that are coupled with G12/13 invariably couple with one or more other G protein subtypes, usually Gq.

    451689: '''Interleukin 1 (IL1) signals via Interleukin 1 receptor 1 (IL1R1), the only signaling-capable IL1 receptor. This is a single chain type 1 transmembrane protein comprising an extracellular ligand binding domain and an intracellular  region called the Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain that is structurally conserved and shared by other members of the two families of receptors (Xu et al. 2000). This domain is also shared by the downstream adapter molecule MyD88. IL1 binding to IL1R1 leads to the recruitment of a second receptor chain termed the IL1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP or IL1RAcP) enabling the formation of a high-affinity ligand-receptor complex that is capable of signal transduction. Intracellular signaling is initiated by the recruitment of MyD88 to the IL-1R1/IL1RAP complex. IL1RAP is only recruited to IL1R1 when IL1 is present; it is believed that a TIR domain signaling complex is formed between the receptor and the adapter TIR domains. The recruitment of MyD88 leads to the recruitment of Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-1 and -4, probably via their death domains. IRAK4 then activates IRAK1, allowing IRAK1 to autophosphorylate. Both IRAK1 and IRAK4 then dissociate from MyD88 (Brikos et al. 2007) which remains stably complexed with IL-1R1 and IL1RAP. They in turn interact with Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor (TNFR)-Associated Factor 6 (TRAF6), which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Deng et al. 2000). TRAF6 is then thought to auto-ubiquinate, attaching K63-polyubiquitin to itself with the assistance of the E2 conjugating complex Ubc13/Uev1a. K63-pUb-TRAF6 recruits Transforming Growth Factor (TGF) beta-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1) in a complex with TAK1-binding protein 2 (TAB2) and TAB3, which both contain nuclear zinc finger motifs that interact with K63-polyubiquitin chains (Ninomiya-Tsuji et al. 1999). This activates TAK1, which then activates  inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) kinase 2 (IKK2 or IKKB) within the IKK complex, the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of IkappaB. The IKK complex also contains the scaffold protein NF-kappa B essential modulator (NEMO). TAK1 also couples to the upstream kinases for p38 and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). IRAK1 undergoes K63-linked polyubiquination; Pellino E3 ligases are important in this process. (Butler et al. 2007; Ordureau et al. 2008). The activity of these proteins is greatly enhanced by IRAK phosphorylation (Schauvliege et al. 2006), leading to K63-linked polyubiquitination of IRAK1. This recruits NEMO to IRAK1, with NEMO binding to polyubiquitin (Conze et al. 2008).<br><br>TAK1 activates IKKB (and IKK), resulting in phosphorylation of the inhibitory IkB proteins and enabling translocation of NFkB to the nucleus; IKKB also phosphorylates NFkB p105, leading to its degradation and the subsequent release of active TPL2 that triggers the extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 MAPK cascade. TAK1 can also trigger the p38 and JNK MAPK pathways via activating the upstream MKKs3, 4 and 6. The MAPK pathways activate a number of downstream kinases and transcription factors that co-operate with NFkB to induce the expression of a range of TLR/IL-1R-responsive genes. There are reports suggesting that IL1 stimulation increases nuclear localization of IRAK1 (Bol et al. 2000) and that nuclear IRAK1 binds to the promoter of NFkB-regulated gene and IkBa, enhancing binding of the NFkB p65 subunit to NFkB responsive elements within the IkBa promoter.  IRAK1 is required for IL1-induced Ser-10 phosphorylation of histone H3 in vivo (Liu et al. 2008). However, details of this aspect of IRAK1 signaling mechanisms remain unclear.
Interleukin-18 is another Interleukin-1 related cytokine which signals through IL18R and IL18RAP subunit receptors (which share homology with IL1R and IL1RAP in the cytokine signaling cascade). Later it follows a MYD88/IRAK1/TRAF6 cascade signaling until reach the NFKB activation (Moller et al. 2002). Interleukin 33, 36, 37 and 38 are relatively recently discovered Interleukin-1 related citokines which are also able to signal through IL1 receptor subunits or other as IL18R, IL37R (Schmitz et al. 2005, Yi et al. 2016, Lunding et al. 2015, van de Veendorck et al. 2012, Lin et al. 2001).''',

This is the initial reaction in the biosynthesis of GalNAc-type O linked oligosaccharides (Wandall et al. 1997). This reaction takes place in the Golgi apparatus (Rottger et al. 1998). There are 20 known members of the GALNT family, 15 of which have been characterised and 5 candidate members which are thought to belong to this family based on sequence similarity (Bennett et al. 2012). The GALNT-family is classified as belonging to CAZy family GT27. Defects in one of the GALNT family genes, GALNT3 (MIM:601756), can cause familial hyperphosphatemic tumoral calcinosis (HFTC; MIM:211900). HFTC is a rare autosomal recessive severe metabolic disorder characterised by the progressive deposition of calcium phosphate crystals in the skin, soft tissues and sometimes bone (Chefetz et al. 2005). The biochemical observation is hyperphosphatemia, caused by increased renal absorption of phosphate (Chefetz et al. 2005, Ichikawa et al. 2005).

The first three members have the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity for which the family is named (Sadler AJ & Williams BR 2008), whereas OASL is devoid of this activity despite sharing significant sequence similarity with the other OAS proteins (Zhu J et al. 2015). OAS1, 2, and 3 are activated by double-stranded RNA to synthesize 5'-triphosphorylated 2'-5'-oligoadenylates (2-5A) from ATP (Kerr IM & Brown RE 1978).

Two types of SMASE can be distinguished downstream of TNFR1 signaling, acid and neutral SMASEs (Adam-Klages S et al. 1996, 1998). Neutral SMASE (such as SMPD2,3) has a pH optimum of 7.4, requires Mg2+ ions and is found at the plasma membrane (Rao BG and Spence MW 1976). Acid SMASE is active at pH 4-5, is Zn2+-dependent and is mainly localized in the lysosomes. The death domain of TNFR1 that is responsible for the initiation of the apoptotic pathway also mediates activation of an acid SMASE. The two proapoptotic adaptor proteins TRADD and FADD are also involved in the activation of acid SMASE signaling events (Schwandner R et al. 1998). TNF-alpha can also activate the pro-apoptotic  acidic SMASE via caspase-8 mediated activation of caspase-7 which in turn proteolytically cleaves and activates the 72kDa pro-acid SMASE form (Edelmann B et al. 2011). Neutral SMASE(SMPD) binds to adaptor protein NSMAF (FAN), which bridges it to NSMASE-activating domain (NSD) of TNFR1 (Adam D et al. 1996; Adam-Klages S et al. 1996; Ségui B et al. 2001).

Two of these mutations - N535K (paralogous to the FGFR2 N550K allele found in endometrial cancers) and V550E - have been shown to support the oncogenic transformation of NIH 3T3 cells (Taylor, 2009).  An FGFR4 Y367C mutation has also been identified in breast cancers (Ruhe, 2007; Roidl, 2010); mutations of paralogous residues in FGFR2 and FGFR3 are associated with both skeletal dysplasias and the development of diverse cancers (Pollock, 2007; Ruhe, 2007; Rousseau, 1996; Chesi, 1997, 2001).<br><br><br>Finally, a SNP at position 388 of FGFR4 is associated with aggressive disease development.

    2045084: '''A number of skeletal and developmental diseases have been shown to arise as a result of mutations in the FGFR1, 2 and 3 genes.  These include dwarfism syndromes (achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia and the neonatal lethal disorders thanatophoric dysplasia I and II), as well as craniosynostosis disorders such as Pfeiffer, Apert, Crouzon, Jackson-Weiss and Muenke syndromes (reviewed in Webster and Donoghue 1997; Burke, 1998, Cunningham, 2007; Harada, 2009).  These mutations fall into four general regions of the receptor: a) the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain II-III linker region,  b) the alternatively spliced second half of the Ig III domain, c) the transmembrane domain and d) the tyrosine kinase domain (reviewed in Webster and Donoghue, 1997).  With the exception of mutations in class b), which affect only the relevant splice variant, these mutations may be present in either the 'b' or 'c' isoforms. These activating mutations affect FGFR function by altering or expanding the ligand-binding range of the receptors (see for instance Ibrahimi, 2004a), by promoting ligand-independent dimerization (for instance, Galvin,1996; Neilson and Friesel, 1996; d'Avis,1998) or by increasing the activity of the kinase domain (for instance, Webster, 1996; Naski, 1996; Tavormina, 1999; Bellus, 2000).  Thus, a number of the point mutations found in FGFR receptors alter their activity without altering their intrinsic kinase activity.  Many of the mutations that promote constitutive dimerization do so by creating or removing cysteine residues; the presence of an unpaired cysteine in the receptor is believed to promote dimerization through the formation of intramolecular disulphide bonds (Galvin, 1996; Robertson, 1998). Paralogous mutations at equivalent positions have been identified in more than one FGF receptor, sometimes giving rise to different diseases.  For instance, mutation of the highly conserved FGFR2 Ser252-Pro253 dipeptide in the region between the second and third Ig domain is responsible for virtually all cases of Apert Syndrome (Wilkie, 1995), while paralogous mutations in FGFR1 (S252R) and FGFR3 (P250R) are associated with Pfeiffer and Crouzon syndromes, respectively (Bellus, 1996).  FGFR4 is unique in that mutations of this gene are not known to be associated with any developmental disorders.<br><br>Recently, many of the same activating mutations in the FGFR genes that have been characterized in skeletal and developmental disorders have begun to be identified in a range of cancers (reviewed in  Turner and Gross, 2010; Greulich and Pollock, 2011; Wesche, 2011).  The best established link between a somatic mutation of an FGFR and the development of cancer is in the case of FGFR3, where 50% of bladder cancers have mutations in the FGFR3 coding sequence.  Of these mutations, which largely match the activating mutations seen in thanatophoric dysplasias, over half occur at a single residue (S249C) (Cappellen, 1999; van Rhijn, 2002).  Activating mutations have also been identified in the coding sequences of FGFR1, 2 and 4 (for review, see Wesche, 2011)<br><br>In addition to activating point mutations, the FGFR1, 2 and 3 genes are subject to misregulation in cancer through gene amplification and translocation events, which are thought to lead to overexpression and ligand-independent dimerization (Weiss, 2010; Turner, 2010; Kunii, 2008; Takeda, 2007; Chesi, 1997; Avet-Loiseau, 1998; Ronchetti, 2001).  It is important to note, however, that in each of these cases, the amplification or translocation involve large genomic regions encompassing additional genes, and the definitive roles of the FGFR genes in promoting oncogenesis has not been totally established. In the case of FGFR1, translocation events also give rise to FGFR1 fusion proteins that contain the intracellular kinase domain of the receptor fused to a dimerization domain from the partner gene.  These fusions, which are expressed in a pre-leukemic myeloproliferative syndrome, dimerize constitutively based on the dimerization domain provided by the fusion partner and are constitutively active (reviewed in Jackson, 2010).<br><br>''',
    156828: '''While circularization of mRNA during translation initiation is thought to contribute to an increase in the efficiency of translation, it also appears to provide a mechanism for translational silencing. This might be achieved by bringing inhibitory 3' UTR-binding proteins into a position in which they interfere either with the function of the translation initiation complex or with the assembly of the ribosome  (Mazumder et al 2001).  Translational silencing of Ceruloplasmin (Cp)  occurs 16 hrs after its induction by INF-gamma (Mazumder et al., 1997). Although the mechanism by which silencing occurs has not yet been determined,  this process is mediated by the L13a  subunit of the 60s ribosome and  thought to require circularization of the Cp mRNA (Sampath et  al., 2003; Mazumder et al., 2001; Mazumder et al., 2003). Between 14 and 16 hrs after INF gamma induction, the L13a subunit of the 60s ribosome is phosphorylated and released from the 60s subunit.

    169119: '''Since the presence of intracellular dsRNA serves as the signal for virus infection and triggers host interferon (IFN) synthesis the simplest model for viral NS1 protein function is that it sequesters dsRNA and thus prevents the downstream signaling required to activate IRF-3, NF-kB and AP-1. These findings are strongly supported by mutational analyses of NS1 that indicate that the IFN antagonist properties of NS1 depend on its ability to bind dsRNA. However, a compensatory mutation (S42G), which was acquired during the passaging of the mutant RNA-binding virus, results in partial restoration of wild-type phenotype but does not restore RNA binding. This indicates that the ability of NS1 to inhibit IFN synthesis is not solely dependent on dsRNA binding and that additional mechanisms may be involved.''',

It is quite possible that recognition of at least some other TLR2 ligands may be assisted by additional accessory proteins, particularly in association with TLR1 or TLR6. TLR2 is expressed constitutively on macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells, and can be induced in some other cell types, including epithelial cells. TLR1 and TLR6, on the other hand, are expressed almost ubiquitously (Muzio et al. 2000).

In both branches, reactions in the cytosol, the mitochondrial matrix, and the peroxisomal matrix result in modifications to the ring structure, shortening and oxidation of the side chain, conversion to a Coenzyme A derivative, and conjugation with the amino acids glycine or taurine (Russell 2003).

    8934599: '''At the level of transcription, expression of the RUNX1 transcription factor is regulated by two alternative promoters: a distal promoter, P1, and a proximal promoter, P2. P1 is more than 7 kb upstream of P2 (Ghozi et al. 1996). In mice, the Runx1 gene is preferentially transcribed from the proximal P2 promoter during generation of hematopoietic cells from hemogenic endothelium. In fully committed hematopoietic progenitors, the Runx1 gene is preferentially transcribed from the distal P1 promoter (Sroczynska et al. 2009, Bee et al. 2010). In human T cells, RUNX1 is preferentially transcribed from P1 throughout development, while developing natural killer cells transcribe RUNX1 predominantly from P2. Developing B cells transcribe low levels of RUNX1 from both promoters (Telfer and Rothenberg 2001).<br>RUNX1 mRNAs transcribed from alternative promoters differ in their 5'UTRs and splicing isoforms of RUNX1 have also been described. The function of alternative splice isoforms and alternative 5'UTRs has not been fully elucidated (Challen and Goodell 2010, Komeno et al. 2014).<br>During zebrafish hematopoiesis, RUNX1 expression increases in response to NOTCH signaling, but direct transcriptional regulation of RUNX1 by NOTCH has not been demonstrated (Burns et al. 2005). RUNX1 transcription also increases in response to WNT signaling. BothTCF7 and TCF4 bind the RUNX1 promoter (Wu et al. 2012, Hoverter et al. 2012), and RUNX1 transcription driven by the TCF binding element (TBE) in response to WNT3A treatment is inhibited by the dominant-negative mutant of TCF4 (Medina et al. 2016). In developing mouse ovary, Runx1 expression is positively regulated by Wnt4 signaling (Naillat et al. 2015).<br>Studies in mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells imply that RUNX1 may be a direct transcriptional target of HOXB4 (Oshima et al. 2011).<br>Conserved cis-regulatory elements were recently identified in intron 5 of RUNX1. The RUNX1 breakpoints observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with translocation (8;21), which result in expression of a fusion RUNX1-ETO protein, cluster in intron 5, in proximity to these not yet fully characterized cis regulatory elements (Rebolledo-Jaramillo et al. 2014).<br>At the level of translation, RUNX1 expression is regulated by various microRNAs which bind to the 3'UTR of RUNX1 mRNA and inhibit its translation through endonucleolytic and/or nonendonucleolytic mechanisms. MicroRNAs that target RUNX1 include miR-378 (Browne et al. 2016), miR-302b (Ge et al. 2014), miR-18a (Miao et al. 2015), miR-675 (Zhuang et al. 2014), miR-27a (Ben-Ami et al. 2009), miR-17, miR-20a, miR106 (Fontana et al. 2007) and miR-215 (Li et al. 2016).<br>At the posttranslational level, RUNX1 activity is regulated by postranslational modifications and binding to co-factors. SRC family kinases phosphorylate RUNX1 on multiple tyrosine residues in the negative regulatory domain, involved in autoinhibition of RUNX1. RUNX1 tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with reduced binding of RUNX1 to GATA1 and increased binding of RUNX1 to the SWI/SNF complex, leading to inhibition of RUNX1-mediated differentiation of T-cells and megakaryocytes. SHP2 (PTPN11) tyrosine phosphatase binds to RUNX1 and dephosphorylates it (Huang et al. 2012).<br>Formation of the complex with CBFB is necessary for the transcriptional activity of RUNX1 (Wang et al. 1996). Binding of CCND3 and probably other two cyclin D family members, CCND1 and CCND2, to RUNX1 inhibits its association with CBFB (Peterson et al. 2005), while binding to CDK6 interferes with binding of RUNX1 to DNA without affecting formation of the RUNX1:CBFB complex. Binding of RUNX1 to PML plays a role in subnuclear targeting of RUNX1 (Nguyen et al. 2005).<br>RUNX1 activity and protein levels vary during the cell cycle. RUNX1 protein levels increase from G1 to S and from S to G2 phases, with no increase in RUNX1 mRNA levels. CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of RUNX1 at the G2/M transition is implicated in reduction of RUNX1 transactivation potency and may promote RUNX1 protein degradation by the anaphase promoting complex (reviewed by Friedman 2009).''',

In trans ligand-receptor binding is followed by ADAM10 mediated (Gibb et al. 2010, Shimizu et al. 2000) and gamma secretase complex mediated cleavage of NOTCH2 (Saxena et al. 2001, De Strooper et al. 1999), resulting in the release of the intracellular domain of NOTCH2, NICD2, into the cytosol. NICD2 traffics to the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional regulator. For a recent review of the cannonical NOTCH signaling, please refer to Kopan and Ilagan 2009, D'Souza et al. 2010, Kovall and Blacklow 2010. CNTN1 (contactin 1), a protein involved in oligodendrocyte maturation (Hu et al. 2003) and MDK (midkine) (Huang et al. 2008, Gungor et al. 2011), which plays an important role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, can also bind NOTCH2 and activate NOTCH2 signaling.<br><br>In the nucleus, NICD2 forms a complex with RBPJ (CBF1, CSL) and MAML (mastermind). The NICD2:RBPJ:MAML complex activates transcription from RBPJ binding promoter elements (RBEs) (Wu et al. 2000). NOTCH2 coactivator complexes directly stimulate transcription of HES1 and HES5 genes (Shimizu et al. 2002), both of which are known NOTCH1 targets. NOTCH2 but not NOTCH1 coactivator complexes, stimulate FCER2 transcription. Overexpression of FCER2 (CD23A) is a hallmark of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and correlates with the malfunction of apoptosis, which is thought be an underlying mechanism of B-CLL development (Hubmann et al. 2002). NOTCH2 coactivator complexes together with CREBP1 and EP300 stimulate transcription of GZMB (granzyme B), which is important for the cytotoxic function of CD8+ T cells (Maekawa et al. 2008).<br><br>NOTCH2 gene expression is differentially regulated during human B-cell development, with NOTCH2 transcripts appearing at late developmental stages (Bertrand et al. 2000).<br><br> NOTCH2 mutations are a rare cause of Alagille syndrome (AGS). AGS is a dominant congenital multisystem disorder characterized mainly by hepatic bile duct abnormalities. Craniofacial, heart and kidney abnormalities are also frequently observed in the Alagille spectrum (Alagille et al. 1975). AGS is predominantly caused by mutations in JAG1, a NOTCH2 ligand (Oda et al. 1997, Li et al. 1997), but it can also be caused by mutations in NOTCH2 (McDaniell et al. 2006).<br><br><br>Hajdu-Cheney syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by severe and progressive bone loss, is caused by NOTCH2 mutations that result in premature C-terminal NOTCH2 truncation, probably leading to increased NOTCH2 signaling (Simpson et al. 2011, Isidor et al. 2011, Majewski et al. 2011).

    2122957: '''Mature NOTCH1 heterodimer on the cell surface is activated by one of its ligands: DLL1 (Cordle et al. 2008, Jarriault et al. 1998), DLL4 (Benedito et al. 2009), JAG1 (Li et al. 1998, Benedito et al. 2009) or JAG2 (Luo et al. 1997, Shimizu et al. 2000), expressed in trans on a neighboring cell. Thus, a ligand-expressing cell is a signal-sending cell, while the NOTCH1 expressing cell is a signal-receiving cell. If NOTCH1 has undergone Fringe modification in the Golgi, it is preferentially activated by Delta ligands (Yang et al. 2005), DLL1 and DLL4. <br><br><br>Upon binding to NOTCH1 on a neighboring cell, NOTCH ligands are ubiquitinated by Mindbomb (MIB1 and MIB2) and/or Neuralized (NEURL and NEURL1B) E3 ubiquitin ligases and endocytosed (Koo et al. 2007, Koo et al. 2005, Itoh et al. 2003, Lai et al. 2001, Koutelou et al. 2008, Song et al. 2006). Endocytosis of ubiquitinated ligands is thought to mechanically stretch the bound NOTCH1 receptor, exposing a cleavage site S2 that is recognized by ADAM10 and/or ADAM17 metalloprotease (van Tetering et al. 2009, Brou et al. 2000, Hartmann et al. 2002, Pan et al. 1997). S2 cleavage of NOTCH1 produces the NEXT1 fragment which is further cleaved at an S3 cleavage site by the gamma-secretase complex, resulting in release of the NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD1) into the cytosol (de Strooper et al. 1999, Schroeter et al. 1998, Huppert et al. 2000). NICD1 produced by activation of NOTCH1 in response to in trans presented Delta and Jagged ligands (DLL/JAG) traffics to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription regulator.<br><br><br>NOTCH1 signaling can also be activated by ligands other than DLL1, DLL4, JAG1 and JAG2. CNTN1 (Contactin-1), transiently expressed during central and peripheral nervous system development, activates NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 in trans, promoting oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination (Hu et al. 2003). DNER (Delta and Notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor) is a transmembrane protein specifically expressed in dendrites and cell bodies of postmitotic neurons. Activation of NOTCH1 by DNER in trans may play an important role in development of the central nervous system by influencing differentiation of astrocytes (Eiraku et al. 2005). Activation of NOTCH1 by both CNTN1 and DNER is Deltex (DTX)-dependent and results in gamma-secretase mediated release of NICD1. Three members of the Deltex protein family: DTX1, DTX2 and DTX4 possess a domain involved in binding cdc10/ankyrin repeats of NOTCH. DTX proteins are considered as positive regulators of NOTCH signaling, although the exact mechanism has not been elucidated (Matsuno et al. 1998, Kishi et al. 2001).In addition, DTX can mediate downregulation of NOTCH signaling by recruiting non-visual beta-arrestins to NOTCH (Mukherjee et al. 2005), thereby trigerring NOTCH ubiquitination. DTX proteins are negatively regulated by ITCH (AIP4) ubiquitin ligase (Chastagner et al. 2006).<br><br>NOTCH1 signaling in the signal-receiving cell can be turned off in cis by expression of NOTCH ligands DLL/JAG (Cordle et al. 2008, Sprinzak et al. 2010), as well as DLK1 (Baladron et al. 2005, Bray et al. 2008). Formation of NOTCH1:ligand complexes in cis prevents interaction of NOTCH1 with ligands expressed in trans, resulting in the inhibition of NOTCH signaling. In the signal-sending cell, NOTCH signaling can be negatively regulated by the protein NUMB, which is asymmetrically distributed during cell division (Rhyu et al. 1994). NUMB recruits ITCH ubiquitin ligase to NOTCH1 and promotes sorting of NOTCH1 through late endosomes for degradation (McGill et al. 2009, Chastagner et al. 2008). ''',

    2122958: '''NICD1 produced by activation of NOTCH1 in response to Delta and Jagged ligands (DLL/JAG) presented in trans, traffics to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription regulator. In the nucleus, NICD1 displaces the NCOR corepressor complex from RBPJ (CSL). When bound to the co-repressor complex that includes NCOR proteins (NCOR1 and NCOR2) and HDAC histone deacetylases, RBPJ (CSL) represses transcription of NOTCH target genes (Kao et al. 1998, Zhou et al. 2000, Perissi et al. 2004, Perissi et al. 2008). Once the co-repressor complex is displaced, NICD1 recruits MAML (mastermind-like) to RBPJ, while MAML recruits histone acetyltransferases EP300 (p300) and PCAF, resulting in formation of the NOTCH coactivator complex that activates transcription from NOTCH regulatory elements. The minimal functional NOTCH coactivator complex that activates transcription from NOTCH regulatory elements is a heterotrimer composed of NICD, MAML and RBPJ (Fryer et al. 2002, Wallberg et al. 2002, Nam et al. 2006). <br><br> <br>NOTCH1 coactivator complex is known to activate transcription of HES1 (Jarriault et al. 1995), HES5 (Arnett et al. 2010), HEY genes (Fischer et al. 2004, Leimeister et al. 2000, Maier et al. 2000, Arnett et al. 2010) and MYC (Palomero et al. 2006) and likely regulates transcription of many other genes (Wang et al. 2011). NOTCH1 coactivator complex on any specific regulatory element may involve additional transcriptional regulatory proteins. HES1 binds TLE proteins, forming an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional corepressor involved in regulation of neurogenesis, segmentation and sex determination (Grbavec et al. 1996, Fisher et al. 1996, Paroush et al. 1994). <br><br>After NOTCH1 coactivator complex is assembled on a NOTCH-responsive promoter, MAML (mastermind-like) recruits CDK8 in complex with cyclin C, triggering phosphorylation of conserved serine residues in TAD and PEST domains of NICD1 by CDK8. Phosphorylated NICD1 is recognized by the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 which ubiquitinates NICD1, leading to degradation of NICD1 and downregulation of NOTCH1 signaling. FBXW7-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of NOTCH1 depend on C-terminally located PEST domain sequences in NOTCH1 (Fryer et al. 2004, Oberg et al. 2001, Wu et al. 2001). The PEST domain of NOTCH1 and the substrate binding WD40 domain of FBXW7 are frequent targets of mutations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia - T-ALL (Welcker and Clurman 2008). <br><br> NICD1, which normally has a short half-life, can be stabilized by binding to the hypoxia-inducable factor 1-alpha (HIF1A) which accumulates in the nucleus when oxygen levels are low.

Many growth factors and their receptor-type protein tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play a critical role in inflammation, wound healing and tissue remodelling. The growth factor hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (MST1, also known as macrophage-stimulating protein, MSP) binds to a specific receptor, macrophage-stimulating protein receptor (MST1R, also known as RON, recepteur d'origine nantais). MST1 belongs to the kringle protein family, which includes HGF and plasminogen. It is produced by the liver and circulates in the blood as a biologically-inactive single chain precursor (pro-MST1). Proteolytic cleavage of pro-MST1 into the biologically-active MST1 dimer is necessary for receptor binding. Cleavage occurs during blood coagulation and at inflammatory sites, the resultant MST1 dimer then binds MST1R receptors on local macrophages. MST1R is ubiquitously expressed but mainly in epithelial cells.<br><br>MST1 binding to MST1R promotes receptor homodimerisation which in turn allows autophosphorylation of two tyrosine residues within the catalytic site which regulates kinase activity and allows phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal binding site of the receptor.

    1549530: '''Signaling by AKT is one of the key outcomes of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation. AKT is activated by the cellular second messenger PIP3, a phospholipid that is generated by PI3K. In ustimulated cells, PI3K class IA enzymes reside in the cytosol as inactive heterodimers composed of p85 regulatory subunit and p110 catalytic subunit. In this complex, p85 stabilizes p110 while inhibiting its catalytic activity. Upon binding of extracellular ligands to RTKs, receptors dimerize and undergo autophosphorylation. The regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85, is recruited to phosphorylated cytosolic RTK domains either directly or indirectly, through adaptor proteins, leading to a conformational change in the PI3K IA heterodimer that relieves inhibition of the p110 catalytic subunit. Activated PI3K IA phosphorylates PIP2, converting it to PIP3; this reaction is negatively regulated by PTEN phosphatase. PIP3 recruits AKT to the plasma membrane, allowing TORC2 to phosphorylate a conserved serine residue of AKT. Phosphorylation of this serine induces a conformation change in AKT, exposing a conserved threonine residue that is then phosphorylated by PDPK1 (PDK1). Phosphorylation of both the threonine and the serine residue is required to fully activate AKT. The active AKT then dissociates from PIP3 and phosphorylates a number of cytosolic and nuclear proteins that play important roles in cell survival and metabolism.

CDGs are divided into 2 main groups: type I CDGs comprise defects in the assembly of the dolichol lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) chain and its transfer to the nascent protein, whereas type II CDGs comprise defects in the trimming and processing of protein-bound glycans (Marquardt & Denecke 2003, Grunewald et al. 2002, Hennet 2012, Cylwik et al. 2013).''',

    70896: '''The branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, and valine, are all essential amino acids (i.e., ones required in the diet). They are major constituents of muscle protein. The breakdown of these amino acids starts with two common steps catalyzed by enzymes that act on all three amino acids: reversible transamination by branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase, and irreversible oxidative decarboxylation by the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. Isovaleryl-CoA is produced from leucine by these two reactions, alpha-methylbutyryl-CoA from isoleucine, and isobutyryl-CoA from valine. These acyl-CoA's undergo dehydrogenation, catalyzed by three different but related enzymes, and the breakdown pathways then diverge. Leucine is ultimately converted to acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate; isoleucine to acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA; and valine to succinyl-CoA. Under fasting conditions, substantial amounts of all three amino acids are generated by protein breakdown. In muscle, the final products of leucine, isoleucine, and valine catabolism can be fully oxidized via the citric acid cycle; in liver they can be directed toward the synthesis of ketone bodies (acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA) and glucose (succinyl-CoA) (Chuang & Shih 2001, Sweetman & Williams 2001).''',

    881905: '''Gastrin is a hormone whose main function is to stimulate secretion of hydrochloric acid by the gastric mucosa, which results in gastrin formation inhibition. This hormone also acts as a mitogenic factor for gastrointestinal epithelial cells. Gastrin has two biologically active peptide forms, G34 and G17.Gastrin gene expression is upregulated in both a number of pre-malignant conditions and in established cancer through a variety of mechanisms. Depending on the tissue where it is expressed and the level of expression, differential processing of the polypeptide product leads to the production of different biologically active peptides. In turn, acting through the classical gastrin cholecystokinin B receptor CCK-BR, its isoforms and alternative receptors, these peptides trigger signalling pathways which influence the expression of downstream genes that affect cell survival, angiogenesis and invasion (Wank 1995, de Weerth et al. 1999, Grabowska & Watson 2007)''',

DT40 chicken cells defective in both Pol kappa and Rad18 (a regulator of Pol kappa, which regulates TLS in yeast) showed an additive effect on UV sensitivity. Interestingly, the level of sister chromatid exchange, which reflects HR mediated repair, was elevated in normally cycling pol kappa cells. This implies functional redundancy between HR and Pol kappa in maintaining chromosomal DNA.

    433141: '''Proteins with transporting functions can be roughly classified into 3 categories: ATP-powered pumps, ion channels, and transporters. Pumps utilize the energy released by ATP hydrolysis to power the movement of the substrates across the membrane, against their electrochemical gradient. Channels at the open state can transfer the substrates (ions or water) down their electrochemical gradient, at an extremely high efficiency (up to 108 s-1). Transporters facilitate the movement of a specific substrate either against or following their concentration gradient, at a lower speed (about 102 -104 s-1); as generally believed, conformational change of the transporter protein is involved in the transfer process.<br><br>According to the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee,  all human transporters can be grouped into the solute-carrier (SLC) superfamily (http://www.genenames.org/genefamilies/SLC). Currently, there are 55 SLC families in the superfamily, with a total of at least 362 putatively functional protein-coding genes (Hediger et al. 2004, He et al. 2009; http://www.bioparadigms.org/slc/intro.htm). At least 20-25% amino-acid sequence identity is shared by members belonging to the same SLC family.  No homology is shared between different SLC families. While the HUGO nomenclature system by definition only includes human genes, the nomenclature system has been informally extended to include rodent species through the use of lower cases letters (e.g., Slc1a1 denotes the rodent ortholog of the human SLC1A1 gene).  And it's worthwhile to mention that pumps, channels and aquaporins are not included in SLC superfamily.<br><br>To date, nine SLC gene families (SLC4, SLC5, SLC8, SLC9, SLC12, SLC20, SLC24, SLC26 and SLC34) comprise the group that exclusively transports inorganic cations and anions across membranes. A further eight SLC gene families (SLC1, SLC6, SLC7, SLC16, SLC25, SLC36, SLC38 and SLC43) are involved in the transport of amino acids and oligopeptides (He et al. 2009). Two gene families are responsible for glucose transport in humans. SLC2 (encoding GLUTs) and SLC5 (encoding SGLTs) families mediate glucose absorption in the small intestine, glucose reabsorption in the kidney, glucose uptake by the brain across the blood-brain barrier and glucose release by all cells in the body (Wood & Trayhurn 2003).<br><br>SLC transporters are able to transport bile salts, organic acids, metal ions and amine compounds. Myo-Inositol is a precursor to phosphatidylinositols (PtdIns) and to the inositol phosphates (IP), which serve as second messengers and also act as key regulators of many cell functions (Schneider 2015). Mono-, di- and tri-carboxylate transporters mediate the transport of these acids across cellular membranes (Pajor 2006, Morris & Felmlee 2008). Essential metals are transported by metal-transporting proteins, which also control their efflux to avoid toxic build-up (Bressler et al. 2007). The SLC6 gene family encodes proteins that mediate neurotransmitter uptake in the central nervous system (CSN) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), thus terminating a synaptic signal (Chen et al. 2004). Urea transport is particularly important in the process of urinary concentration and for rapid urea equilibrium in non-renal tissues (Olives et al. 1994). Choline uptake is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. SLC genes SLC5A7 and the SLC44 family encode choline transporters (Traiffort et al. 2005). The SLC22 gene family of solute carriers function as organic cation transporters (OCTs), cation/zwitterion transporters (OCTNs) and organic anion transporters (OATs). They play important roles in drug absorption and excretion. Substrates include xenobiotics, drugs, and endogenous amine compounds (Koepsell & Endou 2004).<br><br>The human SLC5A6 encodes the Na+-dependent multivitamin transporter SMVT (Prasad et al. 1999). SMVT co-transports biotin (vitamin B7), D-Pantothoate (vitamin B5) and lipoic acid into cells with Na+ ions electrogenically. Four SLC gene families encode transporters that play key roles in nucleoside and nucleobase uptake for salvage pathways of nucleotide synthesis, and in the cellular uptake of nucleoside analogues used in the treatment of cancers and viral diseases (He et al. 2009). The human gene SLC33A1 encodes acetyl-CoA transporter AT1 (Kanamori et al. 1997). Acetyl-CoA is transported to the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, where it serves as the substrate of acetyltransferases that O-acetylates sialyl residues of gangliosides and glycoproteins. Nucleotide sugars are used as sugar donors by glycosyltransferases to create the sugar chains for glycoconjugates such as glycoproteins, polysaccharides and glycolipids. The human solute carrier family SLC35 encode nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs), localised on Golgi and ER membranes, which can mediate the antiport of nucleotide sugars in exchange for the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates (eg. UMP for UDP-sugars) (Handford et al. 2006). Long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) can be used for energy sources and steroid hormone synthesis and regulate many cellular processes such as inflammation, blood pressure, the clotting process, blood lipid levels and the immune response. The SLC27A family encode fatty acid transporter proteins (FATPs) (Anderson & Stahl 2013). The SLC gene family members SLCO1 SLCO2 and SLCO3 encode organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs). OATPs are membrane transport proteins that mediate the sodium-independent transport of a wide range of amphipathic organic compounds including bile salts, steroid conjugates, thyroid hormones, anionic oligopeptides and numerous drugs (Hagenbuch & Meier 2004).''',

Subsequent additions of two galactoses and a glucuronide moiety completes the linker sequence. From here, the next hexosamine addition is critical as it determines which GAG is formed (Lamberg & Stoolmiller 1974, Pavao et al. 2006).''',
    3876087: '''Eukaryotic DNA is associated with histone proteins and organized into a complex nucleoprotein structure called chromatin. This structure decreases the accessibility of DNA but also helps to protect it from damage. Access to DNA is achieved by highly regulated local chromatin decondensation. <br><br>The 'building block' of chromatin is the nucleosome. This contains ~150 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer which consists of two each of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 in a 1.65 left-handed superhelical turn (Luger et al. 1997, Andrews & Luger 2011).<br><br>Most organisms have multiple genes encoding the major histone proteins. The replication-dependent genes for the five histone proteins are clustered together in the genome in all metazoans. Human replication-dependent histones occur in a large cluster on chromosome 6 termed HIST1, a smaller cluster HIST2 on chromosome 1q21, and a third small cluster HIST3 on chromosome 1q42 (Marzluff et al. 2002). Histone genes are named systematically according to their cluster and location within the cluster.<br><br><br><br><br>The 'major' histone genes are expressed primarily during the S phase of the cell cycle and code for the bulk of cellular histones. Histone variants are usually present as single-copy genes that are not restricted in their expression to S phase, contain introns and are often polyadenylated (Old & Woodland 1984 ). Some variants have significant differences in primary sequence and distinct biophysical characteristics that are thought to alter the properties of nucleosomes. Others localize to specific regions of the genome. Some variants can exchange with pre-existing major histones during development and differentiation, referred to as replacement histones (Kamakaka & Biggins 2005). These variants can become the predominant species in differentiated cells (Pina & Suau 1987, Wunsch et al. 1991). Histone variants may have specialized functions in regulating chromatin dynamics. <br><br>The H2A histone family has the highest sequence divergence and largest number of variants. H2A.Z and H2A.XH2A are considered 'universal variants', found in almost all organisms (Talbert & Henikoff 2010). Variants differ mostly in the C-terminus, including the docking domain, implicated in interactions with the (H3-H4)x2 tetramer within the nucleosome, and in the L1 loop, which is the interaction interface of H2A-H2B dimers (Bonisch & Hake 2012). Canonical H2A proteins are expresssed almost exclusively during S-phase. There are several nearly identical variants (Marzluff et al. 2002). No functional specialization of these canonical H2A isoforms has been demonstrated (Bonisch & Hake 2012).  Reversible histone modifications such as acetylation and methylation regulate transcription from genomic DNA, defining the 'readability' of genes in specific tissues (Kouzarides 2007, Marmorstein & Trievel 2009, Butler et al. 2012).<br><br>N.B. The coordinates of post-translational modifications represented here follow Reactome standardized naming, which includes the UniProt standard practice whereby coordinates refer to the translated protein before any further processing.

    2028803: '''Phagocytosis is one of the important innate immune responses that function to eliminate invading infectious agents. Monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils are the professional phagocytic cells. Phagocytosis is a complex process involving the recognition of invading foreign particles by specific types of phagocytic receptors and the subsequent internalization of the particles. Fc gamma receptors (FCGRs) are among the best studied phagocytic receptors that bind to Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG). Through their antigen binding F(ab) end, antibodies bind to specific antigen while their constant (Fc) region binds to FCGRs on phagocytes. The clustering of FCGRs by IgG antibodies on the phagocyte initiates a variety of signals, which lead, through the reorganisation of actin cytoskeleton and membrane remodelling, to the formation of pseudopod and phagosome. Fc gamma receptors are classified into three classes: FCGRI, FCGRII and FCGRIII. Each class of these FCGRs consists of several individual isoforms. Among all these isoforms FCGRI, FCGRIIA and FCGRIIIA, are able to mediate phagocytosis (Joshi et al. 2006, Garcia Garcia & Rosales 2002, Nimmerjahn & Ravetch 2006).''',

It is the end product of glycolysis and the starting point for gluconeogenesis, and can be generated by transamination of alanine. It can be converted by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to acetyl CoA (Reed and Hackert 1990) which can enter the TCA cycle or serve as the starting point for the syntheses of long chain fatty acids, steroids, and ketone bodies depending on the tissue and metabolic state in which it is formed. It also plays a central role in balancing the energy needs of various tissues in the body. Under conditions in which oxygen supply is limiting, e.g., in exercising muscle, or in the absence of mitochondria, e.g., in red blood cells, re-oxidation of NADH produced by glycolysis cannot be coupled to generation of ATP.

Most CDGs cause neurological impairment ranging from severe psychomotor retardation to mild intellectual disability. Defects in N-glycosylation are the main cause of CDGs (Marquardt & Denecke 2003, Grunewald et al. 2002, Hennet 2012, Goreta et al. 2012) and can be identified by a characteristic abnormal isoelectric focusing profile of plasma transferrin (Jaeken et al. 1984, Stibler & Jaeken 1990). Disorders of O-glycosylation, glycosaminoglycan and glycolipid metabolism have recently been discovered and, together with N-glycosylation, represent the major pathways affected by glycan biosynthetic disorders (Freeze 2006, Jaeken 2011).

The processes of energy metabolism can be classified into two groups according to whether they involve carbohydrate-derived or lipid-derived molecules, and within each group it is useful to distinguish processes that mediate the breakdown and oxidation of these molecules to yield energy from ones that mediate their synthesis and storage as internal energy reserves. Synthetic reactions are conveniently grouped by the chemical nature of the end products, such as nucleotides, amino acids and related molecules, and porphyrins. Detoxification reactions (biological oxidations) are likewise conveniently classified by the chemical nature of the toxin.<p>At the same time, all of these processes are tightly integrated. Intermediates in reactions of energy generation are starting materials for biosyntheses of amino acids and other compounds, broad-specificity oxidoreductase enzymes can be involved in both detoxification reactions and biosyntheses, and hormone-mediated signaling processes function to coordinate the operation of energy-generating and energy-storing reactions and to couple these to other biosynthetic processes.''',

When a ligand binds to a G protein-coupled receptor, it stabilises a conformation with an high affinity for the G-protein bound to GDP. GDP is then exchanged for GTP on the Galpha subunit. This exchange triggers the dissociation of the Galpha subunit from the Gbeta-gamma dimer and the receptor. Galpha-GTP and Gbeta-gamma, can then modulate different signalling cascades and effector proteins, while the receptor is able to activate another G protein, resulting in an amplification cascade.

    374073: '''Damage to single nucleotides in a DNA duplex is common, often due to the action of endogenous oxidizing agents or environmental stresses. Base excision repair is a two-step process to repair such damage. First, a DNA glycosylase recognizes a specific modified base in a damaged strand of a DNA duplex and removes it by catalyzing cleavage of the glycosylic bond, leaving an abasic site without disruption of the phosphate-sugar DNA backbone of the damaged strand. Then, these apurinic or apyrimidinic (AP) sites are resolved by cleavage of the backbone of the damaged strand and removal of deoxyribose, insertion of a nucleotide residue or residues complementry to those in the undamaged strand, and ligation. Base excision repair may occur by either a single-nucleotide replacement pathway or a multiple-nucleotide patch replacement pathway, depending on the structure of the terminal sugar phosphate residue (Lindahl and Wood 1999).''',
    374074: '''The ability of cells to tolerate DNA damage, even at the cost of decreased genomic stability, is as biologically important as their ability to repair such damage. Such tolerance to unexcised lesions encountered during replication is attributed to DNA damage bypass pathways that utilize novel Y family polymerases to allow resumption of the movement of DNA replication forks that stall after encountering damage. Translesion synthesis (TLS) utilizes the error-prone DNA polymerase (Pol) zeta, Pol eta and Pol kappa, which lack 3' to 5' exonuclease activities and synthesize DNA with low fidelity and weak processivity. The combination of these activities allows the TLS Pols to bypass the damaged bases and thereby restore movement of a stalled replication fork. Rad6/Rad18 mediated mono-ubiquitination of PCNA plays an important, albeit incompletely worked out, role in recruiting such polymerases at the damaged sites (Edmunds et al. 2008).''',

Chk1 controlled centrosome duplication is a general response to DNA damage in tumor cells, especially in cells arrested at the G2-M phase of the cell cycle or in an extended S-phase under conditions of hydroxyurea-induced replication stress. Chicken DT40 cells expressing kinase-dead (D130A) or phosphorylation site(S345A) Chk1 mutants, or cells in which Chk1 levels were knocked down, did not show centrosome overduplication, indicating an essential role of Chk1 catalytic activity in this process. The centrosomal localization of human Chk1 also indicates a potential role at the centrosome. It is still unclear whether the actual role for Chk1 signaling is to cause a cell-cycle delay, or if Chk1 directly affects centromere amplification upon DNA damage. A role for Cdc25-mediated regulation of Cdk2 (cyclin dependent kinase2) acting downstream of Chk1 has also been implicated.''',
    75068: '''Co-transcriptional pre-mRNA splicing is not obligatory. Pre-mRNA splicing begins co-transcriptionally and often continues post-transcriptionally. Human genes contain an average of nine introns per gene, which cannot serve as splicing substrates until both 5' and 3' ends of each intron are synthesized. Thus the time that it takes for pol II to synthesize each intron defines a minimal time and distance along the gene in which splicing factors can be recruited. The time that it takes for pol II to reach the end of the gene defines the maximal time in which splicing could occur co-transcriptionally. Thus, the kinetics of transcription can affect the kinetics of splicing.<br>
There are two classes of intronless pre-mRNAs (mRNAs expressed from genes that lack introns). The first class encodes the replication dependent histone mRNAs.  These mRNAs have unique 3' ends that do not have a polyA tail.

    390482: '''The eukaryotic chaperonin TCP-1 ring complex (TRiC/ CCT) plays an essential role in the folding of a subset of  proteins  prominent among which are the actins and tubulins (reviewed in Altschuler and Willison, 2008).  CCT/TRiC is an example of a type II chaperonin, defined (in contrast to type I) as functioning in the absence of a cochaperonin.  TriC/CCT is a multisubunit toroidal complex that forms a cylinder containing two back-to-back stacked rings enclosing a cavity where substrate folding occurs in an ATP dependent process  (reviewed in Altschuler and Willison, 2008  ). CCT/TriC contains eight paralogous subunits that are conserved throughout eukaryotic organisms (Leroux and Hartl 2000; Archibald et al. 2001; Valpuesta et al. 2002). CCT-mediated folding of non-native substrate protein involves capture through hydrophobic contacts with multiple chaperonin subunits followed by transfer of the protein  into the central ring cavity where it folds.  Although folding is initiated within this central cavity, only  5%-20% of proteins that are released have partitioned to the native state. The remaining portion  is then recaptured by other chaperonin molecules (Cowan and Lewis 2001). This cycling process may be repeated multiple times before a  target protein partitions to the native state.   In the cell, binding to CCT occurs via presentation of target protein bound to upstream chaperones. During translation, the emerging polypeptide chain may be transferred from the ribosome to CCT via  the chaperone Prefoldin (Vainberg et al., 1998) or the Hsp70 chaperone machinery (Melville et al., 2003).  While the majority of CCT substrates ultimately partition to the native state as soluble, monomeric proteins, alpha and beta tubulin are unusual in that they require additional cofactors that are required to assemble the tubulin  heterodimer (Cowan and Lewis 2001).''',
    5432659: '''Of the roughly 1000 human mitochondrial proteins only 13 proteins, all of them hydrophobic inner membrane proteins that are components of the oxidative phosphorylation apparatus, are encoded in the mitochondrial genome and translated by mitoribosomes at the matrix face of the inner membrane (reviewed in Herrmann et al. 2012, Hallberg and Larsson 2014, Lightowlers et al. 2014). The remainder, including all proteins of the mitochondrial translation system, are encoded in the nucleus and imported from the cytosol into the mitochondrion. Translation in the mitochondrion reflects both the bacterial origin of the organelle and subsequent divergent evolution during symbiosis (reviewed in Huot et al. 2014, Richman et al. 2014). Human mitochondrial ribosomes have a low sedimentation coefficient of only 55S, but at 2.71 MDa they retain a similar mass to E. coli 70S particles. The 55S particles are protein-rich compared to both cytosolic ribosomes and eubacterial ribosomes. This is due to shorter mt-rRNAs, mitochondria-specific proteins, and numerous rearrangements in individual protein positions within the two ribosome subunits (inferred from bovine ribosomes in Sharma et al. 2003, Greber et al. 2014, Kaushal et al. 2014, reviewed in Agrawal and Sharma 2012).<br>Mitochondrial mRNAs have either no untranslated leader or short leaders of 1-3 nucleotides, with the exception of the 2 bicistronic transcripts, RNA7 and RNA14, which have overlapping orfs that encode ND4L/ND4 and ATP8/ATP6 respectively. Translation is believed to initiate with the mRNA binding the 28S subunit:MTIF3 (28S subunit:IF-3Mt, 28S subunit:IF2mt) complex together with MTIF2:GTP (IF-2Mt:GTP, IF2mt:GTP) at the matrix face of the inner membrane (reviewed in Christian and Spremulli 2012). MTIF3 can dissociate 55S particles in preparation for initiation, enhances formation of initiation complexes, and inhibits N-formylmethionine-tRNA (fMet-tRNA) binding to 28S subunits in the absence of mRNA. Binding of fMet-tRNA to the start codon of the mRNA results in a stable complex while absence of a start codon at the 5' end of the mRNA causes eventual dissociation of the mRNA from the 28S subunit. After recognition of a start codon, the 39S subunit then binds the stable complex, GTP is hydrolyzed, and the initiation factors MTIF3 and MTIF2:GDP dissociate.<br>Translation elongation then proceeds by cycles of aminoacyl-tRNAs binding, peptide bond formation, and displacement of deacylated tRNAs. In each cycle an aminoacyl-tRNA in a complex with TUFM:GTP (EF-Tu:GTP) binds at the A-site of the ribosome, GTP is hydrolyzed, and TUFM:GDP dissociates. The elongating polypeptide bonded to the tRNA at the P-site is transferred to the aminoacyl group at the A-site by peptide bond formation at the peptidyl transferase center, leaving a deacylated tRNA at the P-site and the elongating polypeptide attached to the tRNA at the A-site. The polypeptide is co-translationally inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane via an interaction with OXA1L (Haque et al. 2010, reviewed in Ott and Hermann 2010). After peptide bond formation, GFM1:GTP (EF-Gmt:GTP) then binds the ribosome complex, GTP is hydrolyzed, GFM1:GDP dissociates, and the ribosome translocates 3 nucleotides in the 3' direction along the mRNA, relocating the polypeptide-tRNA to the P-site and allowing another cycle to begin. TUFM:GDP is regenerated to TUFM:GTP by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor TSFM (EF-Ts, EF-TsMt).<br>Translation is terminated when MTRF1L:GTP (MTRF1a:GTP) recognizes an UAA or UAG termination codon at the A-site of the ribosome (Tsuboi et al. 2009). GTP hydrolysis does not appear to be required. The tRNA-aminoacyl bond between the translated polypeptide and the final tRNA at the P-site is hydrolyzed by the 39S subunit, facilitating release of  the polypeptide. MRRF (RRF) and GFM2:GTP (EF-G2mt:GTP) then act to release the remaining tRNA and mRNA from the ribosome and dissociate the 55S ribosome into 28S and 39S subunits.<br>Mutations have been identified in genes encoding mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and translation factors.

    5625179: '''Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is a motor-based process that controls the anterograde and retrograde transport of large protein complexes, ciliary cargo and structural components along the ciliary axoneme (reviewed in Cole and Snell, 2009). IFT particles contain two multiprotein IFT subcomplexes, IFT A and IFT B, with ~6 and ~15 subunits, respectively. Linear arrays of IFT A and IFT B 'trains' assemble at the ciliary base along with the active plus-end directed kinesin-2 motors and the inactive dynein motors and traffic along the microtubules at a rate of ~2 micrometers per second. At the ciliary tip, the IFT trains disassemble, releasing cargo and motors, and smaller IFT trains are subsequently reassembled for retrograde traffic driven by the now active minus-end directed dynein-2 motors. Retrograde trains travel down the length of the axoneme at a rate of ~3 micrometers per second and are disassembled and recycled for further rounds of transport at the ciliary base (reviewed in Taschner et al, 2012; Bhogaraju et al, 2013; Ishikawa et al, 2011). Mutations in kinesin-2 motors or IFT B complex members tend to abrogate cilium formation, while mutations in dynein-2 motor or in IFT A complex members generally result in short, bulging cilia that abnormally accumulate IFT particles. These observations are consistent with a primary role for IFT B and IFT A complexes in anterograde and retrograde transport, respectively (see for instance, Huangfu et al, 2005; Follit et al, 2006; May et al, 2005; Tran et al, 2008; reviwed in Ishikawa et al, 2011).

RB1 tumor suppressor, the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, is the third member of the pocket protein family. RB1 binds to E2F transcription factors E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3 and inhibits their transcriptional activity, resulting in prevention of G1/S transition (Chellappan et al. 1991, Bagchi et al. 1991, Chittenden et al. 1991, Lees et al. 1993, Hiebert 1993, Wu et al. 2001). Once RB1 is phosphorylated on serine residue S795 by Cyclin D:CDK4/6 complexes, it can no longer associate with and inhibit E2F1-3. Thus, CDK4/6-mediated phosphorylation of RB1 leads to transcriptional activation of E2F1-3 target genes needed for the S phase of the cell cycle (Connell-Crowley et al. 1997). CDK2, in complex with cyclin E, contributes to RB1 inactivation and also activates proteins needed for the initiation of DNA replication (Zhang 2007). Expression of D type cyclins is regulated by extracellular mitogens (Cheng et al. 1998, Depoortere et al. 1998).

Four main types of cilia have been identified in humans: 9+2 motile (such as respiratory cilia), 9+0 motile (nodal cilia), 9+2 non-motile (kinocilium of hair cells) and 9+0 non-motile (primary cilium and photoreceptor cells)  (reviewed in Fliegauf et al, 2007).

This pathway describes cilia formation, with an emphasis on the primary cilium. The primary cilium is a sensory organelle that is required for the transduction of numerous external signals such as growth factors, hormones and morphogens, and an intact primary cilium is needed for signaling pathways mediated by Hh, WNT, calcium, G-protein coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases, among others (reviewed in Goetz and Anderson, 2010; Berbari et al, 2009; Nachury, 2014). Unlike the motile cilia, which are generally present in large numbers on epithelial cells and are responsible for sensory function as well as wave-like beating motions, the primary cilium is a non-motile sensory organelle that is present in a single copy at the apical surface of most quiescent cells (reviewed in Hsiao et al, 2012). 

Cilium biogenesis involves the anchoring of the basal body, a centriole-derived organelle, near the plasma membrane and the subsequent polymerization of the microtubule-based axoneme and extension of the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011; Reiter et al, 2012). Although the ciliary membrane is continuous with the plasma membrane, the protein and lipid content of the cilium and the ciliary membrane are distinct from those of the bulk cytoplasm and plasma membrane (reviewed in Emmer et al, 2010; Rohatgi and Snell, 2010). This specialized compartment is established and maintained during cilium biogenesis by the formation of a ciliary transition zone, a proteinaceous structure that, with the transition fibres, anchors the basal body to the plasma membrane and acts as a ciliary pore to limit free diffusion from the cytosol to the cilium (reviewed in Nachury et al, 2010; Reiter et al, 2012). Ciliary components are targeted from the secretory system to the ciliary base and subsequently transported to the ciliary tip, where extension of the axoneme occurs, by a motor-driven process called intraflagellar transport (IFT). Anterograde transport of cargo from the ciliary base to the tip of the cilium requires kinesin-2 type motors, while the dynein-2 motor is required for retrograde transport back to the ciliary base.  In addition, both anterograde and retrograde transport depend on the IFT complex, a multiprotein assembly consisting of two subcomplexes, IFT A and IFT B. The primary cilium is a dynamic structure that undergoes continuous steady-state turnover of tubulin at the tip; as a consequence, the IFT machinery is required for cilium maintenance as well as biogenesis (reviewed in Bhogaraju et al, 2013; Hsiao et al, 2012; Li et al, 2012; Taschner et al, 2012; Sung and Leroux, 2013). 

The importance of the cilium in signaling and cell biology is highlighted by the wide range of defects and disorders, collectively known as ciliopathies, that arise as the result of mutations in genes encoding components of the ciliary machinery (reviewed in Goetz and Anderson, 2010; Madhivanan and Aguilar, 2014).''',
    349536: '''The neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft released by the pre-synaptic neuron binds specific receptors located on the post-synaptic terminal. These receptors are either ion channels or G protein coupled receptors that function to transmit the signals from the post-synaptic membrane to the cell body.''',
    5625181: '''Proteomic studies suggest that the cilium is home to approximately a thousand proteins, and has a unique protein and lipid make up relative to the bulk cytoplasm and plasma membrane (Pazour et al, 2005; Ishikawa et al, 2012; Ostrowoski et al, 2002; reviewed in Emmer et al, 2010; Rohatgi and Snell, 2010). In addition, the cilium is a dynamic structure, and the axoneme is continually being remodeled by addition and removal of tubulin at the distal tip (Marshall and Rosenbaum, 2001; Stephens, 1997; Song et al, 2001). As a result, the function and structure of this organelle relies on the directed trafficking of protein and vesicles to the cilium. Small GTPases of the RAS, RAB, ARF and ARL families are involved in cytoskeletal organization and membrane traffic and are required to regulate the traffic from the Golgi and the trans-Golgi network to the cilium (reviewed in Deretic, 2013; Li et al, 2012). ARF4 is a Golgi-resident GTPase that acts in conjunction with a ciliary-targeting complex consisting of the ARF-GAP ASAP1, RAB11A, the RAB11 effector FIP3 and the RAB8A guanine nucleotide exchange factor RAB3IP/RABIN8 to target cargo bearing a putative C-terminal VxPx targeting motif to the cilium. A well-studied example of this system involves the trafficking of rhodopsin to the retinal rod photoreceptors, a specialized form of the cilium (reviewed in Deretic, 2013). ARL3, ARL13B and ARL6 are all small ARF-like GTPases with assorted roles in ciliary trafficking and maintenance. Studies in C. elegans suggest that ARL3 and ARL13B have opposing roles in maintaining the stability of the anterograde IFT trains in the cilium (Li et al, 2010). In addition, both ARL3 and ARL13B have roles in facilitating the traffic of subsets of ciliary cargo to the cilium. Myristoylated cargo such as peripheral membrane protein Nephrocystin-3 (NPHP3) is targeted to the cilium in a UNC119- and ARL3-dependent manner, while ARL13B is required for the PDE6-dependent ciliary localization of INPP5E (Wright et al, 2011; Humbert et al, 2012; reviewed in Li et al, 2012). ARL6 was also identified as BBS3, a gene that when mutated gives rise to the ciliopathy Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). ARL6 acts upstream of a complex of 8 other BBS-associated proteins known as the BBSome. ARL6 and the BBSome are required for the ciliary targeting of proteins including the melanin concentrating hormone receptor (MCHR) and the somatostatin receptor (SSTR3), among others (Nachury et al, 2007; Loktev et al, 2008; Jin et al, 2010; Zhang et al, 2011). Both the BBSome and ARL6 may continue to be associated with cargo inside the cilium, as they are observed to undergo typical IFT movements along the axoneme (Fan et al, 2004; Lechtreck et al, 2009; reviewed in Li et al, 2012).

    374114: '''Dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr 32 kDa (DARPP-32), was identified as a major target for dopamine and protein kinase A (PKA) in striatum. Recent advances now indicate that regulation DARPP-32 phosphorylation provides a mechanism for integrating information arriving at dopaminoceptive neurons, in multiple brain regions, via a variety of neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, neuropeptides, and steroid hormones. Activation of PKA or PKG stimulates DARPP-32 phosphorylation at Thr34, converting DARPP-32 into a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1). DARPP-32 is also phosphorylated at Thr75 by Cdk5, converting DARPP-32 into an inhibitor of PKA. Thus, DARPP-32 has the unique property of being a dual-function protein, acting either as an inhibitor of PP-1 or of PKA.''',
    349539: '''Chemical synapses are specialized junctions that are used for communication between neurons, neurons and muscle or gland cells. The synapse involves  a pre-synaptic neuron and a post-synaptic neuron, muscle cell or glad cell. The pre and the post-synaptic cell are separated by a gap of 20nm called the synaptic cleft. The signals pass in a unidirection from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic. The pre-synaptic neuron communicates via the release of neurotransmitter which bind the receptors on the post-synaptic cell. The process is initiated when an action potential invades the terminal of the presynaptic neuron. 

Action potentials conduct signals along the axon. They occur in electrically excitable cells such as neurons and  cardiac muscle cells. They travel in a wave along the membrane causing voltage sensitive channels to open allowing the influx of Na+ thereby causing the conduction of the signal along the axon. The resting membrane potential of cells including neurons is -70mv. An action potential is generated by a  change in the membrane potential from -70mv to +40mv.

The change in membrane potential leads to the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels in the presynaptic membrane. The external Ca2+ concentration is approximately 10–3 M while the internal Ca2+ concentration is approximately 10–7 M. Opening of calcium channels causes a rapid influx of Ca2+ into the presynaptic terminal. The elevated presynaptic Ca2+ concentration allows synaptic vesicles to fuse with the plasma membrane of the presynaptic neuron and release their contents, most importantly neurotransmitters, into the synaptic cleft. These diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to specific receptors on the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron, causes channels in the postsynaptic membrane to open (or sometimes close), changing the ability of ions to flow in (or out) of the postsynaptic cells. This neurotransmitter-induced current of ions alters the conductance and membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron, altering the probability that the neuron will fire an action potential.''',
    451944: '''Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine that is produced by T cells in response to antigen stimulation. Originally, IL-2 was discovered because of its potent growth factor activity on activated T cells in vitro and was therefore named 'T cell growth factor' (TCGF). However, the generation of IL-2- and IL-2 receptor-deficient mice revealed that IL-2 also plays a regulatory role in the immune system by suppressing autoimmune responses. Two main mechanisms have been identified that explain this suppressive function: (1) IL-2 sensitizes activated T cells for activation-induced cell death (AICD) and (2) IL-2 is critical for the survival and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which possess potent immunosuppressive properties.<br><br>IL-2 signaling occurs when IL-2 binds to the heterotrimeric high-affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), which consists of alpha, beta and gamma chains. The IL-2R was identified in 1981 via radiolabeled ligand binding (Robb et al. 1981). The IL-2R alpha chain was  identified in 1982 (Leonard et al.), the beta chain in 1986/7 (Sharon et al. 1986, Teshigawara et al. 1987) and the IL-2R gamma chain in 1992 (Takeshita et al.). The high affinity of IL-2 binding to the IL-2R is created by a very rapid association rate to the IL-2R alpha chain, combined with a much slower dissociation rate contributed by the combination of the IL-2R beta and gamma chains (Wang & Smith 1987). After antigen stimulation, T cells upregulate the high-affinity IL-2R alpha chain; IL-2R alpha captures IL-2 and this complex then associates with the constitutively expressed IL-2R beta and gamma chains.  The IL-2R gamma chain is shared by several other members of the cytokine receptor superfamily including IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 receptors, and consequently is often referred to as the Common gamma chain (Gamma-c).
The tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3, which are constitutively associated with IL-2R beta and Gamma-c respectively, are activated resulting in phosphorylation of three critical tyrosine residues in the IL-2R beta cytoplasmic tail. These phosphorylated residues enable recruitment of the adaptor molecule Shc, activating the MAPK and PI3K pathways, and the transcription factor STAT5. After phosphorylation, STAT5 forms dimers that translocate to the nucleus and initiate gene expression. While STAT5 activation is critical for IL-2 function in most cell types, the contribution of the PI3K/Akt pathway differs between distinct T cell subsets. In Tregs for example, PI3K/Akt is not involved in IL-2 signaling and this may explain some of the different functional outcomes of IL-2 signaling in Tregs vs. effector T cells. ''',

    349546: '''The human brain contains at least 100 billion neurons, each with the ability to influence many other cells. Clearly, highly sophisticated and efficient mechanisms are needed to enable communication among this astronomical number of elements. This communication occurs across synapses, the functional connection between neurons. Synapses can be divided into two general classes: electrical synapses and chemical synapses. Electrical synapses permit direct, passive flow of electrical current from one neuron to another. The current flows through gap junctions, specialized membrane channels that connect the two cells. Chemical synapses enable cell-to-cell communication using neurotransmitter release. Neurotransmitters are chemical agents released by presynaptic neurons that trigger a secondary current flow in postsynaptic neurons by activating specific receptor molecules. Neurotransmitter secretion is triggered by the influx of Ca2+ through voltage-gated channels, which gives rise to a transient increase in Ca2+ concentration within the presynaptic terminal. The rise in Ca2+ concentration causes synaptic vesicles (the presynaptic organelles that store neurotransmitters) to fuse with the presynaptic plasma membrane and release their contents into the space between the pre- and postsynaptic cells.

    5358963: '''The mismatch repair (MMR) system corrects single base mismatches and small insertion and deletion loops (IDLs) of unpaired bases. MMR is primarily associated with DNA replication and is highly conserved across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. MMR consists of the following basic steps: a sensor (MutS homologue) detects a mismatch or IDL, the sensor activates a set of proteins (a MutL homologue and an exonuclease) that select the nascent DNA strand to be repaired, nick the strand, exonucleolytically remove  a region of nucleotides containing the mismatch, and finally a DNA polymerase resynthesizes the strand and a ligase seals the remaining nick (reviewed in Kolodner and Marsischkny 1999, Iyer et al. 2006, Li 2008, Fukui 2010, Jiricny 2013). <br>Humans have 2 different MutS complexes. The MSH2:MSH6 heterodimer (MutSalpha) recognizes single base mismatches and small loops of one or two unpaired bases. The MSH2:MSH3 heterodimer (MutSbeta) recognizes loops of two or more unpaired bases. Upon binding a mismatch, the MutS complex becomes activated in an ATP-dependent manner allowing for subsequent downstream interactions and movement on the DNA substrate. (There are two mechanisms proposed: a sliding clamp and a switch diffusion model.) Though the order of steps and structural details are not fully known, the activated MutS complex interacts with MLH1:PMS2 (MutLalpha) and PCNA, the sliding clamp present at replication foci. The role of PCNA is multifaceted as it may act as a processivity factor in recruiting MMR proteins to replicating DNA, interact with MLH1:PMS2 and Exonuclease 1 (EXO1) to initiate excision of the recently replicated strand and direct DNA polymerase delta to initiate replacement of bases. MLH1:PMS2 makes an incision in the strand to be repaired and EXO1 extends the incision to make a single-stranded gap of up to 1 kb that removes the mismatched base(s). (Based on assays of purified human proteins, there is also a variant of the mismatch repair pathway that does not require EXO1, however the mechanism is not clear. EXO1 is almost always required, it is possible that the exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase delta may compensate in some situations and it has been proposed that other endonucleases may perform redundant functions in the absence of EXO1.) RPA binds the single-stranded region and a new strand is synthesized across the gap by DNA polymerase delta. The remaining nick is sealed by DNA ligase I (LIG1).<br>Concentrations of MMR proteins MSH2:MSH6 and MLH1:PMS2 increase in human cells during S phase and are at their highest level and activity during this phase of the cell cycle (Edelbrock et al. 2009).

    6788507: '''Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disease of genome instability characterized by congenital skeletal defects, aplastic anemia, susceptibility to leukemias, and cellular sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. Patients with FA have been categorized into at least 15 complementation groups (FA-A, -B, -C, -D1, -D2, -E, -F, -G, -I, -J, -L, -M, -N, -O and -P). These complementation groups correspond to the genes FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCJ/BRIP1, FANCL, FANCM, FANCN/PALB2, FANCO/RAD51C and FANCP/SLX4. Eight of these proteins, FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, and FANCM, together with FAAP24, FAAP100, FAAP20, APITD1 and STRA13, form a nuclear complex termed the FA core complex. The FA core complex is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that recognizes and is activated by DNA damage in the form of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), triggering monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI, which initiates repair of ICL-DNA.<p>FANCD2 and FANCI form a complex and are mutually dependent on one another for their respective monoubiquitination. After DNA damage and during S phase, FANCD2 localizes to discrete nuclear foci that colocalize with proteins involved in homologous recombination repair, such as BRCA1 and RAD51. The FA pathway is regulated by ubiquitination and phosphorylation of FANCD2 and FANCI. ATR-dependent phosphorylation of FANCI and FANCD2 promotes monoubiquitination of FANCD2, stimulating the FA pathway (Cohn and D'Andrea 2008, Wang 2007). The complex of USP1 and WDR48 (UAF1) is responsible for deubiquitination of FANCD2 and negatively regulates the FA pathway (Cohn et al. 2007). <p>Monoubiquitinated FANCD2 recruits DNA nucleases, including SLX4 (FANCP) and FAN1, which unhook the ICL from one of the two covalently linked DNA strands. The DNA polymerase nu (POLN) performs translesion DNA synthesis using the DNA strand with unhooked ICL as a template, thereby bypassing the unhooked ICL. The unhooked ICL is subsequently removed from the DNA via nucleotide excision repair (NER). Incision of the stalled replication fork during the unhooking step generates a double strand break (DSB). The DSB is repaired via homologous recombination repair (HRR) and involves the FA genes BRCA2 (FANCD1), PALB2 (FANCN) and BRIP1 (FANCJ) (reviewed by Deans and West 2011, Kottemann and Smogorzewska 2013). Homozygous mutations in BRCA2, PALB2 or BRIP1 result in Fanconi anemia, while heterozygous mutations in these genes predispose carriers to primarily breast and ovarian cancer. Well established functions of BRCA2, PALB2 and BRIP1 in DNA repair are BRCA1 dependent, but it is not yet clear whether there are additional roles for these proteins in the Fanconi anemia pathway that do not rely on BRCA1 (Evans and Longo 2014, Jiang and Greenberg 2015). Heterozygous BRCA1 mutations predispose carriers to breast and ovarian cancer with high penetrance. Complete loss of BRCA1 function is embryonic lethal. It has only recently been reported that a partial germline loss of BRCA1 function via mutations that diminish protein binding ability of the BRCT domain of BRCA1 result in a FA-like syndrome. BRCA1 has therefore been designated as the FANCS gene (Jiang and Greenberg 2015).<p>The FA pathway is involved in repairing DNA ICLs that arise by exposure to endogenous mutagens produced as by-products of normal cellular metabolism, such as aldehyde containing compounds. Disruption of the aldehyde dehydrogenase gene ALDH2 in FANCD2 deficient mice leads to severe developmental defects, early lethality and predisposition to leukemia. In addition to this, the double knockout mice are exceptionally sensitive to ethanol consumption, as ethanol metabolism results in accumulated levels of aldehydes (Langevin et al. 2011).  ''',

Cholestasis is characterized by the retention of bile acids or salts. Bile acids can damage hepatocytes and bile duct cells leading to inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis and eventually carcinogenesis. PFIC2 patients suffer from chronic cholestasis and develop liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease before adulthood.

    181664: '''Clostridial neurotoxins, when taken up by human neurons, block synaptic transmission by cleaving proteins required for the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane. They are remarkably efficient so that very small doses cause paralysis of an affected person (Lalli et al. 2003; Turton et al. 2002). All characterized clostridial neurotoxins are synthesized as products of chromosomal, plasmid  or prophage-borne bacterial genes. The nascent toxin may be cleaved into light (LC) and heavy (HC) chain moieties that remain attached by noncovalent interactions and a disulfide bond (Turton et al. 2002).<p>Strains of Clostridium botulinum produce seven serologically distinct toxins, BoNT/A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. An eighth toxin, BoNT/H has recently been identified (Barash & Arnon 2014) but its molecular properties have not yet been described. Human poisoning most commonly  result from ingestion of toxin contaminated food. More rarely, it is due to wound infection or clostridial colonization of the gut of an infant whose own gut flora have not yet developed or of an older individual whose flora have been suppressed. While all seven characterized toxins can cleave human target proteins, three, BoNT/A, B, and E, are most commonly associated with human disease (Hatheway 1995; Sakaguchi 1982). BoNT/F is also able to cause human botulism.<p>Once ingested, the botulinum toxin must be taken up from the gut lumen into the circulation, a process mediated by four accessory proteins. These proteins form a complex that mediates transcytosis of the toxin molecule across the gut epithelium, allowing its entry into the circulation. The accessory proteins produced by different C. botulinum strains differ in their affinities for polarized epithelia of different species (e.g., human versus canine), and may thus be a key factor in human susceptibility to the toxins of strains A, B, and E and resistance to the others (Simpson 2004).<p>Clostridium tetani produces TeNT toxin. Human poisoning is the result of toxin secretion by bacteria growing in an infected wound and the toxin is released directly into the circulation.<p>Circulating clostridial toxins are taken up by neurons at neuromuscular junctions. They bind to specific gangliosides (BoNT/C, TeNT) or to both gangliosides and synaptic vesicle proteins (BoNT/A, B, D G) exposed on the neuronal plasma membrane during vesicle exocytosis (Montal 2010). All seven characterized forms of BoNT are thought to be taken up into synaptic vesicles as these re-form at the neuromuscular junction. These vesicles remain close to the site of uptake and are rapidly re-loaded with neurotransmitter and acidified (Sudhoff 2004). TeNT, in contrast, is taken up into clathrin coated vesicles that reach the neuron cell body by retrograde transport and then possibly other neurons before undergoing acidification. Vesicle acidification causes a conformational change in the toxin, allowing its HC part to function as a channel through which its LC part is extruded into the neuronal cytosol. The HC - LC disulfide bond is cleaved and the cytosolic LC functions as a zinc metalloprotease to cleave specific bonds in proteins on the cytosolic faces of synaptic vesicles and plasma membranes that normally mediate exocytosis (Lalli et al. 2003; Montal 2010).''',
    5674401: '''Signaling by PI3K/AKT is frequently constitutively activated in cancer via gain-of-function mutations in one of the two PI3K subunits - PI3KCA (encoding the catalytic subunit p110alpha) or PIK3R1 (encoding the regulatory subunit p85alpha). Gain-of-function mutations activate PI3K signaling by diverse mechanisms. Mutations affecting the helical domain of PIK3CA and mutations affecting nSH2 and iSH2 domains of PIK3R1 impair inhibitory interactions between these two subunits while preserving their association. Mutations in the catalytic domain of PIK3CA enable the kinase to achieve an active conformation. PI3K complexes with gain-of-function mutations therefore produce PIP3 and activate downstream AKT in the absence of growth factors (Huang et al. 2007, Zhao et al. 2005, Miled et al. 2007, Horn et al. 2008, Sun et al. 2010, Jaiswal et al. 2009, Zhao and Vogt 2010, Urick et al. 2011).''',

PTEN can also be inactivated by gene deletion or epigenetic silencing, or indirectly by overexpression of microRNAs that target PTEN mRNA (Huse et al. 2009).

PIP2-bound AKT1 is phosphorylated by TORC2 complex and by PDPK1 that is always present at the plasma membrane, due to low affinity for PIP2.

NSP is involved in the regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation, and specification. For example, it is utilised by continually renewing adult tissues such as blood, skin, and gut epithelium not only to maintain stem cells in a proliferative, pluripotent, and undifferentiated state but also to direct the cellular progeny to adopt different developmental cell fates. Analogously, it is used during embryonic development to create fine-grained patterns of differentiated cells, notably during neurogenesis where the NSP controls patches such as that of the vertebrate inner ear where individual hair cells are surrounded by supporting cells.<br>This process is known as lateral inhibition: a molecular mechanism whereby individual cells within a field are stochastically selected to adopt particular cell fates and the NSP inhibits their direct neighbours from doing the same. The NSP has been adopted by several other biological systems for binary cell fate choice. In addition, the NSP is also used during vertebrate segmentation to divide the growing embryo into regular blocks called somites which eventually form the vertebrae. The core of this process relies on regular pulses of Notch signaling generated from a molecular oscillator in the presomatic mesoderm.<br>The Notch receptor is synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum as a single polypeptide precursor.  Newly synthesized Notch receptor is proteolytically cleaved in the trans-golgi network, creating a heterodimeric mature receptor comprising of non-covalently associated extracellular and transmembrane subunits.

The IL1 receptor (IL1R) family comprises 10 members: Interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL1R1, IL1RA), Interleukin-1 receptor type 2 (IL1R2, IL1RB), Interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP, IL1RAcP, IL1R3), Interleukin-18 receptor 1 (IL18R1, IL18RA) , Interleukin-18 receptor accessory protein (IL18RAP, IL18RB), Interleukin-1 receptor-like 1 (IL1RL1, ST2, IL33R), Interleukin-1 receptor-like 2 (IL1RL2, IL36R), Single Ig IL-1-related receptor (SIGIRR, TIR8), Interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein-like 1 (IL1RAPL1, TIGGIR2) and X-linked interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein-like 2 (IL1RAPL2, TIGGIR1). Most of the genes encoding these receptors are on chromosome 2. 
IL1 family receptors heterodimerize upon cytokine binding. IL1, IL33 and IL36 bind specific receptors, IL1R1, IL1RL1, and IL1RL2 respectively.  All use IL1RAP as a co-receptor. IL18 binds IL18R1 and uses IL18RAP as co-receptor.

The complexes formed by IL1 family cytokines and their heterodimeric receptors recruit intracellular signaling molecules, including Myeloid differentiation primary response protein MyD88 (MYD88), members of he IL1R-associated kinase (IRAK) family, and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), activating Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B (NFκB), as well as Mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14, p38), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and other Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).''',

In humans there are eight LPL receptors, each encoded by a separate gene (these genes also sometimes referred to as "Edg" or endothelial differentiation gene). The ligands for LPLRs are the lysophospholipid extracellular signaling molecules, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). The primary effects are inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as secondary effects of preventing apoptosis and increasing cell proliferation (Contos JJ et al, 2000; An S et al, 1998; Fukushima N and Chun J, 2001).''',

These receptors are widespread in the body and binding of catecholamines produces a sympathetic response ('flight-or-fight response') resulting in increased heart rate, pupil dilation and energy mobilization amongst other responses. There are three major types of adrenoceptor, alpha1, alpha2 and beta. Each type is thought to have three subtypes; alpha1 (1A,1B,1D), alpha2 (2A,2B,2C) and beta (1,2,3) (Bylund DB et al, 1994).''',

Their counterparts are nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), ion channels receptors that are also important in the autonomic nervous system. Many drugs can manipulate these two distinct receptors by acting as selective agonists or antagonists. mAChRs bind to the bioamine acetylcholine, have a widespread tissue distribution and are involved in the control of numerous central and peripheral physiological responses, particularly voluntary muscle contraction. They are also major targets for drugs in human diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and schizophrenia. This family of G-protein coupled receptors consists of five members designated M1-M5 and are sub-divided into two groups based on their primary coupling to G proteins. M2 and M4 receptors couple to Gi/o proteins and M1, M3 and M5 receptors couple to Gq/11 proteins (Caulfield MP and Birdsall NJ, 1998).''',

Deacetylation and methylation of histone H3 in the chromatin of a rRNA gene by eNoSC causes reduced expression of the gene.  When glucose is low, NAD is high (NADH is low), activity of SIRT1 is high, and activity of rRNA genes is reduced. It is hypothesized that eNoSC forms on a nucleosome containing dimethylated lysine-9 on histone H3 (H3K9me2) and then eNoSC deacetylates and dimethylates the adjacent nucleosome, thus catalyzing spreading of H3K9me2 throughout the gene.''',
    8867609: '''Recruitment of plasma membrane-localized cargo into clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles is mediated by interaction with a variety of clathrin-interacting proteins collectively called CLASPs (clathrin-associated sorting proteins).  CLASP proteins, which may be monomeric or tetrameric, are recruited to the plasma membrane through interaction with phosphoinsitides and recognize linear or conformational sequences or post-translational modifications in the cytoplasmic tails of the cargo protein.  Through bivalent interactions with clathrin and/or other CLASP proteins, they bridge the recruitment of the cargo to the emerging clathrin coated pit (reviewed in Traub and Bonifacino, 2013).  The tetrameric AP-2 complex, first identified in early studies of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, was at one time thought to be the primary CLASP protein involved in cargo recognition at the plasma membrane, and indeed plays a key role in the endocytosis of cargo carrying dileucine- or tyrosine-based motifs. <br><br>A number of studies have been performed to test whether AP-2 is essential for all forms of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Keyel et al, 2006; Motely et al, 2003; Huang et al, 2004; Boucrot et al, 2010; Henne et al, 2010; Johannessen et al, 2006; Gu et al, 2013; reviewed in Traub, 2009; McMahon and Boucrot, 2011).

    206349: '''The canonical Wingless signalling pathway consists of two main branches.  One of these is active when Wingless (WG) ligand is bound to Frizzled (FZ/FZ2) receptors and the other is active when there is no binding.  The default pathway is with no WG ligand bound to the FZ/FZ2 receptor.  Armadillo (ARM) is sequestered to the 'destruction complex', is phosphorylated and ubiquitinated, and then degraded by the proteasome.  The ARM concentration in the cytoplasm is depleted so there is no complex formed with Pangolin (PAN) in the nucleus and gene transcription is inactivated.  However, when WG binds with FZ/FZ2, a plasma membrane receptor complex with Arrow (ARR) is formed.  ARR is in turn phosphorylated by the membrane-anchored kinase Gish (GISH) and membrane localised Shaggy (SGG).  The molecules Dishevelled (DSH) and Axin (AXN) are recruited to ARR and FZ/FZ2 respectively, the former along with its interaction partners in the 'destruction complex'.  The binding of DSH to AXN, deactivates SGG and leads to the degradation of AXN.  This, along with dephosphorylation of the 'destruction complex' leads to the release of ARM and the disassembly of the 'destruction complex'.  The levels of cytoplasmic AXN drop and ARM increase with the result that sufficient ARM transports from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to form a complex with PAN which leads to transcriptional activation.''',

Generally, the 5' leader of the pre-tRNA is removed first by endonucleolytic cleavage by the RNase P ribonucleoprotein complex, which contains a catalytic RNA (RNA H1 in humans) and at least 10 protein subunits (reviewed in Jarrous 2002, Xiao et al. 2002, Jarrous and Gopalan 2010).<br>The 3' trailer is then removed by RNase Z activity, a single protein in humans (reviewed in Maraia and Lamichhane 2011).

Glutamate loaded vesicles are formed in the cytoplasm and then transported to a site close to the plasma membrane where the vesicle is docked with the help of several proteins.

The precise molecular mechanisms of the interactions that result in docking versus priming are not clear and the docking and priming process have been combined in this annotation of this pathway. Once primed the synaptic vesicle is ready for release.<br><br><br>Synaptic transmission involves an action potential that is generated in the presynaptic cell which induces the opening of voltage gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) located in the plasma membrane of the presynaptic neuron. Typically N, P/Q and R type of VGCCs are involved in the neurotransmitter release. Ca2+ influx through these channels results in the rise of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. In the microdomain of glutamatergic synapses, the Ca2+ concentration could rise between 10-25 micro molar.  Synaptotagmin, a Ca2+-binding protein located in the synaptic vesicular membrane, responds to the rise in the Ca2+ levels in the microdomain and induces a synaptic vesicle membrane curvature that favors vesicle fusion. Fusion of the synaptic vesicle with the plasma membrane is characterized by the formation of a trimeric trans-SNARE complex that involves VAMP2 from the synaptic vesicle membrane, and syntaxin and SNAP-25 from plasma membrane. Vesicle fusion incorporates the synaptic vesicle membrane into the plasma membrane, releasing the vesicle contents (glutamate) into the synaptic cleft.

    140838: '''The intrinsic pathway of blood clotting connects interactions among kininogen (high molecular weight kininogen, HK), prekallikrein (PK), and factor XII to the activation of clotting factor X by a series of reactions that is independent of the extrinsic pathway and that is not subject to inhibition by TFPI. It is thus essential for the prolongation of the clotting cascade: while the reactions of the extrinsic pathway appear to be sufficient to initiate clot formation, those of the intrinsic pathway are required to maintain it (Broze 1995; Davie et al. 1991; Monroe et al. 2002). The intrinsic pathway can be divided into three parts: 1) reactions involving interactions of kininogen, prekallikrein, and factor XII, leading to the activation of factor XII, 2) reactions involving factor XI, factor IX, factor VIII, and von Willebrand factor (vWF) leading to the activation of factors VIII and IX, and 3) reactions that inactivate factor XIIa and kallikrein.<p>Kininogen, prekallikrein, and factor XII were first identified as proteins needed for the rapid formation of clots when whole blood is exposed to negatively charged surfaces in vitro. Studies in vitro have identified several possible sets of interactions, in which small quantities of one or more of these proteins 'autoactivate' and then catalyze the formation of larger quantities of activated factors. Recent work, however, suggests that these factors form complexes on endothelial cell surfaces mediated by C1q binding protein (C1q bp), that the first activation event is the cleavage of prekallikrein by prolylcarboxypeptidase, and that the resulting kallikrein catalyzes the activation of factor XII (Schmaier 2004).<p>The second group of events, occurs in vivo on the surfaces of activated platelets (although most biochemical characterization of the reactions was originally done with purified proteins in solution). Factor XI binds to the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib:IX:V complex, where it can be activated by cleavage either by thrombin (generated by reactions of the common pathway) or by activated factor XII (generated in the first part of the intrinsic pathway). Activated factor XI in turn catalyzes the activation of factor IX. Simultaneously, factor VIII, complexed with vWF, is cleaved by thrombin, activating it and causing its release from vWF. Activated factors VIII and IX form a complex on the platelet surface that very efficiently converts factor X to activated factor X. (Activated factors X and V then form a complex that efficiently activates thrombin.)<p>While these two groups of events can be viewed as forming a single functional pathway (e.g., Davie et al. 1991), human clinical genetic data cast doubt on this view. Individuals deficient in kininogen, prekallikrein, or factor XII proteins exhibit normal blood clot formation in vivo. In contrast, deficiencies of factor XI can be associated with failure of blood clotting under some conditions, and deficiencies of vWF, factor VIII, or factor IX cause severe abnormalities - von Willebrand disease, hemophilia A, and hemophilia B, respectively. These data suggest that while the second group of events is essential for normal clot formation in vivo, the first group has a different function (e.g., Schmaier 2004).<p>Finally, reactions neutralize proteins activated in the first part of the intrinsic pathway. Kallikrein forms stable complexes with either C1 inhibitor (C1Inh) or with alpha2-macroglobulin, and factor XIIa forms stable complexes with C1Inh. The relevance of these neutralization events to the regulation of blood clotting is unclear, however. The physiological abnormalities observed in individuals who lack C1Inh appear to be due entirely to abnormalities of complement activation; blood clotting appears to proceed normally. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis, above, that factor XIIa plays a limited role in normal blood clotting under physiological conditions.<p>These events are outlined in the drawing: black arrows connect the substrates (inputs) and products (outputs) of individual reactions; blue lines connect activated enzymes to the reactions they catalyze.''',

The eight influenza virus genome segments never exist as naked RNA but are associated with four viral proteins to form viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs). The major viral protein in the RNP complex is the nucleocapsid protein (NP), which coats the RNA. The remaining proteins PB1, PB2 and PA bind to the partially complementary ends of the viral RNA, creating the distinctive panhandle structure. These RNPs (10-20nm wide) are too large to passively diffuse into the nucleus and therefore, once released from an incoming particle must rely on the active import mechanism of the host cell nuclear pore complex. All proteins in the RNP complex can independently localize to the nucleus due to the presence of nuclear localization signals (NLSs) which mediate their interaction with the nuclear import machinery, including the RanGTPase (Fodor, 2004; Deng et al., 2006). However the signals on NP have been shown to be both sufficient and necessary for the import of viral RNA.''',
    390707: '''Like neurexins, Receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) make trans-synaptic adhesion complexes with multiple postsynaptic binding partners to regulate synapse organization. The type IIa RPTPs include three members, Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase F (PTPRF) sometimes referred to as leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR), Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase sigma (PTPRS) and Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase delta (PTPRD). These proteins contain typical cell adhesion immunoglobulin-like (Ig) and fibronectin III (FNIII) domains, suggesting the involvement of RPTPs in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. To date, six different types of postsynaptic organizers for type-IIa RPTPs have been reported: interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP, IL-1RAcP) (Yoshida et al. 2012), IL-1RAcP-like-1 (IL1RAPL1) (Yoshida et al. 2011), Neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (NTRK3, TrkC) (Takahashi et al. 2011), Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 4B (LRRC4B, Netrin-G ligand-3, NGL-3) (Woo et al. 2009, Kwon et al. 2010), the Slit- and Trk-like (Slitrk) family proteins (Takahashi et al. 2012, Yim et al. 2013, Yamagata et al. 2015) and the liprins (Serra-Pagès et al. 1998, Dunah et al. 2005).

CD22 is a glycoprotein found on the surface of B cells during restricted stages of development. CD22 is a member of the receptors of the sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin (Siglec) family which binds specifically to the terminal sequence N-acetylneuraminic acid alpha(2-6) galactose (NeuAc-alpha(2-6)-Gal) present on many B-cell glycoproteins (Powell et al. 1993, Sgroi et al. 1993). CD22 has seven immunoglobulin (Ig)-like extracellular domains and a cytoplasmic tail containing six tyrosines, three of which belong to the inhibitory immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) sequences. Upon BCR cross-linking CD22 is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated by the tyrosine kinase Lyn, thereby recruiting and activating tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-1 and inhibiting calcium signalling.''',
    2127417: '''Collagen trimers in triple-helical form, referred to as procollagen or collagen molecules, are exported from the ER and trafficked through the Golgi network before secretion into the extracellular space. For fibrillar collagens namely types I, II, III, V, XI, XXIV and XXVII (Gordon & Hahn 2010, Ricard-Blum 2011) secretion is concomitant with processing of the N and C terminal collagen propeptides. These processed molecules are known as tropocollagens, considered to be the units of higher order collagen structures. They form within the extracellular space via a process that can proceed spontaneously, but in the cellular environment is regulated by many collagen binding proteins such as the FACIT (Fibril Associated Collagens with Interrupted Triple helices) family collagens and Small Leucine-Rich Proteoglycans (SLRPs). The architecture formed ultimately depends on the collagen subtype and the cellular conditions. Structures include the well-known fibrils and fibres formed by the major structural collagens type I and II plus several different types of supramolecular assembly (Bruckner 2010). The mechanical and physical properties of tissues depend on the spatial arrangement and composition of these collagen-containing structures (Kadler et al. 1996, Shoulders & Raines 2009, Birk & Bruckner 2011).<br><br> Fibrillar collagen structures are frequently heterotypic, composed of a major collagen type in association with smaller amounts of other types, e.g. type I collagen fibrils are associated with types III and V, while type II fibrils frequently contain types IX and XI (Wess 2005). Fibres composed exclusively of a single collagen type probably do not exist, as type I and II fibrils require collagens V and XI respectively as nucleators (Kadler et al. 2008, Wenstrup et al. 2011).  Much of the structural understanding of collagen fibrils has been obtained with fibril-forming collagens, particularly type I, but some central features are believed to apply to at least the other fibrillar collagen subtypes (Wess 2005). Fibril diameter and length varies considerably, depending on the tissue and collagen types (Fang et al. 2012). The reasons for this are poorly understood (Wess 2005).<br><br>Some tissues such as skin have fibres that are approximately the same diameter while others such as tendon or cartilage have a bimodal distribution of thick and thin fibrils. Mature type I collagen fibrils in tendon are up to 1 cm in length, with a diameter of approx. 500 nm. An individual fibrillar collagen triple helix is less than 1.5 nm in diameter and around 300 nm long; collagen molecules must assemble to give rise to the higher-order fibril structure, a process known as fibrillogenesis, prevented by the presence of C-terminal propeptides (Kadler et al. 1987). In electron micrographs, fibrils have a banded appearance, due to regular gaps where fewer collagen molecules overlap, which occur because the fibrils are aligned in a quarter-stagger arrangement (Hodge & Petruska 1963). Collagen microfibrils are believed to have a quasi-hexagonal unit cell, with tropocollagen arranged to form supertwisted, right-handed microfibrils that interdigitate with neighbouring microfibrils, leading to a spiral-like structure for the mature collagen fibril (Orgel et al. 2006, Holmes & Kadler 2006).<br><br>Neighbouring tropocollagen monomers interact with each other and are cross-linked covalently by lysyl oxidase (Orgel et al. 2000, Maki 2006). Mature collagen fibrils are stabilized by lysyl oxidase-mediated cross-links. Hydroxylysyl pyridinoline and lysyl pyridinoline cross-links form between (hydroxy) lysine and hydroxylysine residues in bone and cartilage (Eyre et al. 1984). Arginoline cross-links can form in cartilage (Eyre et al. 2010); mature bovine articular cartilage contains roughly equimolar amounts of arginoline and hydroxylysyl pyridinoline based on peptide yields. Mature collagen fibrils in skin are stabilized by the lysyl oxidase-mediated cross-link histidinohydroxylysinonorleucine (Yamauch et al. 1987). Due to the quarter-staggered arrangement of collagen molecules in a fibril, telopeptides most often interact with the triple helix of a neighbouring collagen molecule in the fibril, except for collagen molecules in register staggered by 4D from another collagen molecule. Fibril aggregation in vitro can be unipolar or bipolar, influenced by temperature and levels of C-proteinase, suggesting a role for the N- and C- propeptides in regulation of the aggregation process (Kadler et al. 1996). In vivo, collagen molecules at the fibril surface may retain their N-propeptides, suggesting that this may limit further accretion, or alternatively represents a transient stage in a model whereby fibrils grow in diameter through a cycle of deposition, cleavage and further deposition (Chapman 1989).<br><br>In vivo, fibrils are often composed from more than one type of collagen. Type III collagen is found associated with type I collagen in dermal fibrils, with the collagen III on the periphery, suggesting a regulatory role (Fleischmajer et al. 1990). Type V collagen associates with type I collagen fibrils, where it may limit fibril diameter (Birk et al. 1990, White et al. 1997). Type IX associates with the surface of narrow diameter collagen II fibrils in cartilage and the cornea (Wu et al. 1992, Eyre et al. 2004). Highly specific patterns of crosslinking sites suggest that collagen IX functions in interfibrillar networking (Wess 2005). Type XII and XIV collagens are localized near the surface of banded collagen I fibrils (Nishiyama et al. 1994). Certain fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACITs) associate with the surface of collagen fibrils, where they may serve to limit fibril fusion and thereby regulate fibril diameter (Gordon & Hahn 2010). Collagen XV, a member of the multiplexin family, is almost exclusively associated with the fibrillar collagen network, in very close proximity to the basement membrane. In human tissues collagen XV is seen linking banded collagen fibers subjacent to the basement membrane (Amenta et al. 2005). Type XIV collagen, SLRPs and discoidin domain receptors also regulate fibrillogenesis (Ansorge et al. 2009, Kalamajski et al. 2010, Flynn et al. 2010).<br><br>Collagen IX is cross-linked to the surface of collagen type II fibrils (Eyre et al. 1987). Type XII and XIV collagens are found in association with type I (Walchli et al. 1994) and type II (Watt et al. 1992, Eyre 2002) fibrils in cartilage. They are thought to associate non-covalently via their COL1/NC1 domains (Watt et al. 1992, Eyre 2002).  <br><br>Some non-fibrillar collagens form supramolecular assemblies that are distinct from typical fibrils. Collagen VII forms anchoring fibrils, composed of antiparallel dimers that connect the dermis to the epidermis (Bruckner-Tuderman 2009). During fibrillogenesis, the nascent type VII procollagen molecules dimerize in an antiparallel manner. The C-propeptides are then removed by Bone morphogenetic protein 1 (Rattenholl et al. 2002) and the processed antiparallel dimers aggregate laterally. Collagens VIII and X form hexagonal networks and collagen VI forms beaded filament (Gordon & Hahn 2010, Ricard-Blum et al. 2011).''',

It blocks cell death by both impinging on the cytoplasmic cell death machinery and by regulating the expression of genes involved in cell death and survival.

    1181246: '''Signaling by EGFR is frequently activated in cancer through activating mutations in the coding sequence of the EGFR gene, resulting in expression of a constitutively active mutant protein. <br><br>Epidermal growth factor receptor kinase domain mutants are present in ~16% of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), but are also found in other cancer types, such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer and thyroid cancer. EGFR kinase domain mutants harbor activating mutations in exons 18-21 which code for the kinase domain (amino acids 712-979) . Small deletions, insertions or substitutions of amino acids within the kinase domain lock EGFR in its active conformation in which the enzyme can dimerize and undergo autophosphorylation spontaneously, without ligand binding (although ligand binding ability is preserved), and activate downstream signaling pathways that promote cell survival (Greulich et al. 2005, Zhang et al. 2006, Yun et al. 2007, Red Brewer et al. 2009). <br><br>Point mutations in the extracellular domain of EGFR are frequently found in glioblastoma. Similar to kinase domain mutations, point mutations in the extracellular domain result in constitutively active EGFR proteins that signal in the absence of ligands, but ligand binding ability and responsiveness are preserved (Lee et al. 2006).  <br><br>EGFR kinase domain mutants need to maintain association with the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) for proper functioning (Shimamura et al. 2005, Lavictoire et al. 2003). CDC37 is a co-chaperone of HSP90 that acts as a scaffold and regulator of interaction between HSP90 and its protein kinase clients. CDC37 is frequently over-expressed in cancers involving mutant kinases and acts as an oncogene (Roe et al. 2004, reviewed by Gray Jr. et al. 2008). <br><br>Over-expression of the wild-type EGFR or EGFR cancer mutants results in aberrant activation of downstream signaling cascades, namely RAS/RAF/MAP kinase signaling and PI3K/AKT signaling, and possibly signaling by PLCG1, which leads to increased cell proliferation and survival, providing selective advantage to cancer cells that harbor activating mutations in the EGFR gene (Sordella et al. 2004, Huang et al. 2007). <br><br>While growth factor activated wild-type EGFR is promptly down-regulated by internalization and degradation, cancer mutants of EGFR demonstrate prolonged activation (Lynch et al. 2004). Association of HSP90 with EGFR kinase domain mutants negatively affects CBL-mediated ubiquitination, possibly through decreasing the affinity of EGFR kinase domain mutants for phosphorylated CBL, so that CBL dissociates from the complex upon phosphorylation and cannot perform ubiquitination (Yang et al. 2006, Padron et al. 2007).  <br><br>Various molecular therapeutics are being developed to target aberrantly activated EGFR in cancer. Non-covalent (reversible) small tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib, selectively bind kinase domain of EGFR, competitively inhibiting ATP binding and subsequent autophosphorylation of EGFR dimers. EGFR kinase domain mutants sensitive to non-covalent TKIs exhibit greater affinity for TKIs than ATP compared with the wild-type EGFR protein, and are therefore preferential targets of non-covalent TKI therapeutics (Yun et al. 2007). EGFR proteins that harbor point mutations in the extracellular domain also show sensitivity to non-covalent tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Lee et al. 2006). EGFR kinase domain mutants harboring small insertions in exon 20 or a secondary T790M mutation are resistant to reversible TKIs (Balak et al. 2006) due to increased affinity for ATP (Yun et al. 2008), and are targets of covalent (irreversible) TKIs that form a covalent bond with EGFR cysteine residue C397. However, effective concentrations of covalent TKIs also inhibit wild-type EGFR, causing severe side effects (Zhou et al. 2009). Hence, covalent TKIs have not shown much promise in clinical trials (Reviewed by Pao and Chmielecki in 2010). ''',

Defects in SLC5A2 are the cause of renal glucosuria (GLYS1; MIM:233100), an autosomal recessive renal tubular disorder characterised by glucosuria in the absence of both hyperglycemia and generalized proximal tubular dysfunction. Establishing definite genotype–phenotype correlations for GLYS1 is made difficult by variable expression of SLC5A2 and because other genes may have an impact on overall renal glucose resorption. Drugs that inhibit SLC5A2 are used to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D).

These DPA derivatives are another branch of the specialised proresolving mediators (SPMs) produced from long-chain fatty acids which have anti-inflammatory properties, even though mechanisms of their anti-inflammatory action have not been fully elucidated (Bannenberg & Serhan 2010, Dangi et al. 2010, Vik et al. 2017, Hansen et al. 2017).<br><br>The biosynthesis of SPMs derived from the two isomers of DPA, DPAn-6 (cis-4,7,10,13,16-docosapentaenoic acid) and DPAn-3 (cis-7,10,13,16,19-docosapentaenoic acid), is described here.

    206411: '''The JAK/STAT pathway is one of the main eukaryotic signalling pathways.  In vertebrates, there are several ligands, receptors, JAK kinases and STAT molecules making detailed study of the system very complex.  In Drosophila, the JAK/STAT pathway is much less redundant, offering one set of related ligands UPD (OS, UPD2, UPD3), a receptor Domeless (DOME), a Janus Associated Kinase Hopscotch (HOP), and a STAT transcription factor (STAT92E).<br><br>The DOME receptor, like many cytokine receptors, contains no tyrosine kinase domain.  However, it is constitutively associated with the kinase HOP.  The DOME receptor dimerises at the plasma membrane whereupon it binds a UPD ligand.  This activates the receptor-associated HOP which are now able to phosphorylate each other and also the cytoplasmic tail of the DOME receptor.  This creates a docking site for monomeric cytoplasmic STAT92E proteins which can bind via their SH2 domains.  Once bound to the receptor complex, STAT92E is itself phosphorylated.  It dissociates from the receptor complex and dimerises, the interaction stabilised by the SH2 domain of one molecule binding to the phospho-Tyr of the other.  The dimer translocates to the nucleus where it binds to a palindromic DNA sequence in the pathway target gene promoters to activate transcription.<br><br>There are also negative regulators present in this pathway.  Some are present in the nucleus and, in the case of SU(VAR)2-10 which is a Drosophila PIAS or Zimp protein, act by binding to STAT92E dimer.  Others, such as the BCL6 orthologue, Ken and Barbie (KEN), bind to DNA sequences on target genes which overlap with STAT92E binding sites.  There is a protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTP61F, that exists in two differently spliced forms.  One is active in the cytosol and dephosphorylates HOP and STAT92E while the other dephosphorylates STAT92E in the nucleus.<br><br>A truncated version of STAT92E, deltaNSTAT92E, that lacks the N-terminal 133 amino acids has also been found.  It is believed this truncated STAT forms homodimers and heterodimers with full-length STAT92E.  Increasing the deltaNSTAT92E to STAT92E ratio in overexpression and RNAi experiments results in the repression of  target gene transcription.  This may be due to the truncated protein failing to attract coactivators or failing to form tetramers, necessary for activation of certain genes and assembled by the N-terminal domains, when two STAT binding sites for dimers are close together (Henrikson et al, 2002; Yan et al, 1996).<br><br>In mammalian systems, SOCS proteins negatively influence the JAK/STAT pathway.  Activated STATs stimulate transcription of the SOCS genes and the resulting SOCS proteins bind phosphorylated JAK kinases and their receptors to turn off the pathway in a simple negative feedback loop.  SOCS can affect their negative regulation in three ways.  First, by binding phospho-Tyr on the receptors to physically block STAT recruitment.  Second, by binding directly to JAKs or the receptors to specifically inhibit JAK kinase activity.  Third, by interacting with elongin BC complex and Cullin 2, facilitating the ubiquitination of JAKs and, presumably, the receptors.  Ubiquitination of these targets decreases their stability by targeting them for proteasomal degradation (Rawlings et al, 2004).<br><br>Three SOCS proteins have been identified in Drosophila: SOCS36E, SOCS44A, and SOCS16D.

    169552: '''Uncoating of viral particles takes place in the host cell endosome. Acidification of the endosome promotes fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes, causing a structural change in the viral hemagglutinin (HA) and freeing the fusion peptide of its HA2 subunit to interact with the endosome membrane. The concerted structural change of several HA molecules opens up a pore through which the viral RNP passes into the cytosol of the cell. The precise timing and the location of uncoating (early vs. late endosomes) depends on the pH-mediated transition of the specific HA molecule involved. The virus-associated M2 ion channel protein allows the influx of H+ ions into the virion, which disrupts protein-protein interactions, resulting in the release of RNP free of the viral M1 matrix protein. Thus the HA mediated fusion of the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane and the M2-mediated release of the RNP results in the release of the RNP complex into the cytosol.

    169562: '''The precise timing and location of uncoating (early vs. late endosomes) depends on the pH-mediated transition of the specific viral hemagglutinin (HA) molecule involved. The uncoating of influenza viruses in endosomes is blocked by changes in pH caused by weak bases (e.g. ammonium chloride and chloroquine) or ionophores (e.g. monensin). Effective uncoating is also dependent on the presence of the viral M2 ion channel protein. Early on it was recognized that amantadine and rimantadine inhibit replication immediately following virus infection. Later it was found that the virus-associated M2 protein allows the influx of H+ ions into the virion, which disrupts protein-protein interactions, resulting in the release of viral RNP free of the viral matrix (M1) protein. Amantadine and rimantadine have been shown to block the ion channel activity of the M2 protein and thus uncoating. The HA mediated fusion of the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane and the M2-mediated release of the RNP results in the appearance of free RNP complexes in the cytosol. This completes the uncoating process. The time frame for the uncoating process has been examined by inhibiting virus penetration with ammonium chloride.

The enzymes that catalyze the first three steps of carnitine synthesis, converting trimethyllysine to gamma-butyrobetaine, are widely distributed in human tissues. The enzyme that catalyzes the last reaction, converting gamma-butyrobetaine to carnitine, is found only in liver and kidney cells, and at very low levels in brain tissues. Other tissues that require carnitine, such as muscle, are dependent on transport systems that mediate its export from the liver and uptake by other tissues (Bremer 1983, Kerner and Hoppel 1998).''',

    140898: '''Factor VII, the protease that initiates the normal blood clotting cascade, circulates in the blood in both its proenzyme (factor VII) and its activated (factor VIIa) forms.  No clotting occurs, however, because neither form of the protein has any catalytic activity when free in solution. Blood clotting is normally initiated when tissue factor (TF), an intrinsic plasma membrane protein, is exposed to the blood by injury to the wall of a blood vessel. TF is then able to bind factor VIIa from plasma, and possibly also factor VII, to form complexes capable of catalyzing the conversion of factor X, from plasma, into its activated form, factor Xa. Factor Xa catalyzes the conversion of additional factor VII molecules to their activated form, increasing the amount of tissue factor:factor VIIa complex available at the site of injury, accelerating the generation of factor Xa, and allowing the activation of factor IXa as well. This process is self-limiting because as levels of factor Xa increase, tissue factor:factor VIIa complexes become trapped in the form of catalytically inactive heterotetramers with factor Xa and the protein TFPI (tissue pathway factor inhibitor). At this point the intinsic pathway, as an independent source of activated factor X, is thought to become critical for the continuation of clot formation (Broze 1995; Mann et al. 2003).<br>The nature of the initial tissue factor:factor VII complexes formed is controversial. One model, building on the observation that the complex of factor VII and TF has low but measurable proteolytic activity on factor X, suggests that this complex begins the activation of factor X, and that as factor VIIa accumulates, tissue factor:factor VIIa complexes also form, accelerating the process (Nemerson 1988).  A second model, building on the observation that normal plasma contains low levels of activated factor VII constitutively, suggests that complexes with factor VIIa form immediately at the onset of clotting (Rapaport and Rao 1995). The two models are not mutually exclusive, and in any event, the central roles of tissue factor and factor VIIa in generating an initial supply of factors IXa and Xa, and the self-limiting nature of the process due to the action of TFPI, are all well-established.<br>These events are outlined in the drawing: black arrows connect the substrates (inputs) and products (outputs) of individual reactions, and blue lines connect output activated enzymes to the other reactions that they catalyze.''',

    2422376: '''The pericentriolar stacks of Golgi cisternae undergo extensive fragmentation and reorganization in mitosis.<br>  <br>In mammalian cells, Golgi apparatus consists of stacked cisternae that are connected by tubules to form a ribbon-like structure in the perinuclear region, in vicinity of the centrosome. Reorganization of the Golgi apparatus during cell division allows both daughter cells to inherit this organelle, and may play additional roles in the organization of the mitotic spindle. <br> <br>First changes in the structure of the Golgi apparatus likely start in G2 and are subtle, involving unlinking of the Golgi ribbon into separate stacks. These changes are required for the entry of mammalian cells into mitosis (Sutterlin et al. 2002). This initial unlinking of the Golgi ribbon depends on GRASP proteins and on CTBP1 (BARS) protein, which induces the cleavage of the tubular membranes connecting the stacks (Hidalgo Carcedo et al. 2004, Colanzi et al. 2007), but the exact mechanism is not known. Activation of MEK1/2 also contributes to unlinking of the Golgi ribbon in G2 (Feinstein and Linstedt 2007). <br> <br>From prophase to metaphase, Golgi cisternae undergo extensive fragmentation that is a consequence of unstacking of Golgi cisternae and cessation of transport through Golgi. At least three mitotic kinases, CDK1, PLK1 and MEK1, regulate these changes. CDK1 in complex with cyclin B phosphorylates GOLGA2 (GM130) and GORASP1 (GRASP65), constituents of a cis-Golgi membrane complex (Lowe et al. 1998, Preisinger et al. 2005). Phosphorylation of GOLGA2 prevents binding of USO1 (p115), a protein localizing to the membrane of ER (endoplasmic reticulum) to Golgi transport vesicles and cis-Golgi, thereby impairing fusion of these vesicles with cis-Golgi cisternae and stopping ER to Golgi transport (Lowe et al. 1998, Seeman et al. 2000, Moyer et al. 2001). Phosphorylation of GORASP1 by CDK1 enables further phosphorylation of GORASP1 by PLK1 (Sutterlin et al. 2001, Preisinger et al. 2005). Phosphorylation of GORASP1 by CDK1 and PLK1 impairs stacking of Golgi cisternae by interfering with formation of GORASP1 trans-oligomers that would normally link the Golgi cisternae together (Wang et al. 2003, Wang et al. 2005, Sengupta and Linstedt 2010). <br><br> In the median Golgi, GORASP2 (GRASP55), a protein that forms a complex with BLFZ1 (Golgin-45) and RAB2A GTPase and contributes to cisternae stacking and Golgi trafficking (Short et al. 2001), is also phosphorylated in mitosis. Phosphorylation of GORASP2 by MEK1/2-activated MAPK1 (ERK2) and/or MAPK3-3 (ERK1b in human, Erk1c in rat) contributes to Golgi unlinking in G2 and fragmentation of Golgi cisternae in mitotic prophase (Acharya et al. 1998, Jesch et al. 2001, Colanzi et al. 2003, Shaul and Seger 2006, Duran et al. 2008, Feinstein and Linstedt 2007, Feinstein and Linstedt 2008, Xiang and Wang 2010).

Thrombin also efficiently catalyzes the activation of several factors  required earlier in the clotting cascade, thus acting in effect as a positive regulator of clotting.  At the same time, thrombin activates protein C, which in turn catalyzes the inactivation of several of these upstream factors, thereby  limiting the clotting process.  Thrombin can be trapped in stable, inactive complexes with: antithrombin-III (SERPINC1), a circulating blood protein; heparin cofactor II (SERPIND1) which inhibits thrombin in a dermatan sulfate–dependent manner in the arterial vasculature; protein C inhibitor (SERPINA5) that inhibits thrombin in complex with thrombomodulin; and Protease nexin-1 (SERPINE2) that inhibits thrombin at the vessel wall and platelet surface.

The entire clotting cascade can be divided into three portions, the extrinsic pathway, the intrinsic pathway, and the common pathway.  The extrinsic pathway begins with the release of tissue factor at the site of vascular injury and leads to the activation of factor X.  The intrinsic pathway provides an alternative mechanism for activation of factor X, starting from the activation of factor XII.

    169590: '''For a budding influenza virus to be fully infectious is it essential that it contains a full complement of the eight vRNA segments. Two different models have been proposed for packaging of the vRNPs into newly assembling virus particles; the random incorporation model and the selective incorporation model.<br>The random incorporation model as its name suggests proposes that there is no selection at all on which vRNPs are packaged. It is assumed that each vRNP has equal probability of being packaged, and that if enough vRNPS are packaged a particular percentage of budding virions will receive at least one copy of each genome segment. This model is supported by evidence that infectious virions may possess more than eight vRNPs assuring the presence of a full complement of eight vRNPs in a significant percentage of virus particles. Mathematical analysis of packaging suggested that twelve RNA segments would need to be packaged in order to obtain approximately 10% of virus particles that are fully infectious (Enami, 1991), a number that is compatible with experimental data (Donald, 1954). Due to the low amount of RNA per virion (estimated at 1-2% w/w), enumeration of the precise number of RNAs packaged in a virion is difficult.<br>The selective incorporation model, suggests that each vRNA segment contains a unique "packaging signal" allowing it to act independently, with each vRNA segment being packaged selectively. There is increasing evidence to support the theory of a packaging signal within the coding regions at both the 5' and 3' end of the genomic RNA, with signals being reported for all segments except segment 7 (Ozawa 2007, Muramoto 2006, Fujii 2005, Fujii 2003, Watanabe 2003, Liang 2005). The exact method by which individual vRNP segments are packaged is not known but it has been hypothesized to occur via specific RNA-RNA or protein-RNA interactions.

Accumulation of M1 at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is thought to be the trigger for the initiation of bud formation.  This bud formation continues until the inner core of the virus is completely enveloped.  Completion of the budding process requires the membrane at the base of the bud to fuse.  Although M1 is thought to be the driving force for bud formation, other viral and cellular proteins have been demonstrated to affect size and shape of the virus particle.  Generally, influenza virus particles are either spherical or filamentous and this characteristic morphology is genetically linked to the M segment (Bourmakina, 2003; Roberts, 1998).

    6788730: '''DNA repair is a phenomenal multi-enzyme, multi-pathway system required to ensure the integrity of the cellular genome. Living organisms are constantly exposed to harmful metabolic by-products, environmental chemicals and radiation that damage their DNA, thus corrupting genetic information. In addition, normal cellular pH and temperature create conditions that are hostile to the integrity of DNA and its nucleotide components. DNA damage can also arise as a consequence of spontaneous errors during DNA replication. The DNA repair machinery continuously scans the genome and maintains genome integrity by removing or mending any detected damage.<p>Depending on the type of DNA damage and the cell cycle status, the DNA repair machinery utilizes several different pathways to restore the genome to its original state. When the damage and circumstances are such that the DNA cannot be repaired with absolute fidelity, the DNA repair machinery attempts to minimize the harm and patch the insulted genome well enough to ensure cell viability.<p>Accumulation of DNA alterations that are the result of cumulative DNA damage and utilization of "last resort" low fidelity DNA repair mechanisms is associated with cellular senescence, aging, and cancer. In addition, germline mutations in DNA repair genes are the underlying cause of many familial cancer syndromes, such as Fanconi anemia, xeroderma pigmentosum, Nijmegen breakage syndrome and Lynch syndrome, to name a few.<p> When the level of DNA damage exceeds the capacity of the DNA repair machinery, apoptotic cell death ensues. Actively dividing cells have a very limited time available for DNA repair and are therefore particularly sensitive to DNA damaging agents. This is the main rationale for using DNA damaging chemotherapeutic drugs to kill rapidly replicating cancer cells.<p>There are seven main pathways employed in human DNA repair: DNA damage bypass, DNA damage reversal, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, repair of double strand breaks and repair of interstrand crosslinks (Fanconi anemia pathway). DNA repair pathways are intimately associated with other cellular processes such as DNA replication, DNA recombination, cell cycle checkpoint arrest and apoptosis.<p>The DNA damage bypass pathway does not remove the damage, but instead allows translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) using a damaged template strand. Translesion synthesis allows cells to complete DNA replication, postponing the repair until cell division is finished. DNA polymerases that participate in translesion synthesis are error-prone, frequently introducing base substitutions and/or small insertions and deletions.<p>The DNA damage reversal pathway acts on a very narrow spectrum of damaging base modifications to remove modifying groups and restore DNA bases to their original state.<p>The base excision repair (BER) pathway involves a number of DNA glycosylases that cleave a vast array of damaged bases from the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone. DNA glycosylases produce a DNA strand with an abasic site. The abasic site is processed by DNA endonucleases, DNA polymerases and DNA ligases, the choice of which depends on the cell cycle stage, the identity of the participating DNA glycosylase and the presence of any additional damage. Base excision repair yields error-free DNA molecules.<p>Mismatch repair (MMR) proteins recognize mismatched base pairs or small insertion or deletion loops during DNA replication and correct erroneous base pairing by excising mismatched nucleotides exclusively from the nascent DNA strand, leaving the template strand intact.<p>Nucleotide excision repair pathway is involved in removal of bulky lesions that cause distortion of the DNA double helix. NER proteins excise the oligonucleotide that contains the lesion from the affected DNA strand, which is followed by gap-filling DNA synthesis and ligation of the repaired DNA molecule. <p>Double strand breaks (DSBs) in the DNA can be repaired via a highly accurate homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway, or through error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), single strand annealing (SSA) and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) pathways. DSBs can be directly generated by some DNA damaging agents, such as X-rays and reactive oxygen species (ROS). DSBs can also be intermediates of the Fanconi anemia pathway.<p>Interstrand crosslinking (ICL) agents damage the DNA by introducing covalent bonds between two DNA strands, which disables progression of the replication fork. The Fanconi anemia proteins repair the ICLs by unhooking them from one DNA strand. TLS enables the replication fork to bypass the unhooked ICL, resulting in two replicated DNA molecules, one of which contains a DSB and triggers double strand break repair, while the sister DNA molecule contains a bulky unhooked ICL, which is removed through NER.<p>Single strand breaks (SSBs) in the DNA, generated either by DNA damaging agents or as intermediates of DNA repair pathways such as BER, are converted into DSBs if the repair is not complete prior to DNA replication. Simultaneous inhibition of DSB repair and BER through cancer mutations and anti-cancer drugs, respectively, is synthetic lethal in at least some cancer settings, and is a promising new therapeutic strategy.<p>For reviews of DNA repair pathways, please refer to Lindahl and Wood 1999 and Curtin 2012.<br>''',
    1660542: '''Phosphatidylinositol (PI), a membrane phospholipid, can be reversibly phosphorylated at the 3, 4, and 5 positions of the inositol ring to generate seven phosphoinositides: phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate PI(3,4)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate PI(3,5)P2, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3). These seven phosphoinositides, which are heterogeneously distributed within cells, can serve as signature components of different intracellular compartment membranes and so help to mediate specificity of membrane interactions. Phosphoinositide levels are tightly regulated spatially and temporally by the action of various kinases and phosphatases whilst PI(4,5)P2 is also a substrate for phospholipase C. The differential localisation of each of these enzymes on specific compartment membranes ensures maintenance of the heterogeneous distribution of phosphoinositides despite the continuous membrane flow from one compartment to another.<br><br>PI is primarily synthesised in the endoplasmic reticulum from where the phospholipid is exported to other compartments via membrane traffic or via cytosolic phospholipid transfer proteins. Phosphorylation of PI to PI4P primarily occurs in the Golgi, where PI4P plays an important role in the biogenesis of transport vesicles such as the secretory vesicle involved in its transport to the plasma membrane. At this place, PI4P has a major function acting as a precursor of PI(4,5)P2, which is located predominantly at this membrane. PI(4,5)P2 binds and regulates a wide range of proteins that function on the cell surface and serves as a precursor for second messengers. Additionally, it helps define this membrane as a target for secretory vesicles, functions as a coreceptor in endocytic processes, and functions as a cofactor for actin nucleation.<br><br>At the plasma membrane, PI(4,5)P2 is further phosphorylated to PI(3,4,5)P3, another phosphoinositide with important signalling functions including stimulating cell survival and proliferation. The inositol 3-phosphatase, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) regenerates PI(4,5)P2, while the 5-phosphatases convert PI(3,4,5)P3 into the phosphoinositide, PI(3,4)P2, propagating the signal initiated by PI(3,4,5)P3. PI(3,4)P2 is further dephosphorylated in the endocytic pathway by inositol 4-phosphatases to PI3P, the signature phosphoinositide of the early endosomal compartment and a ligand for numerous endosomal proteins. However, the bulk of PI3P is generated directly in the endosomes by phosphorylation of PI. The subsequent endosomal phosphorylation of PI3P to PI(3,5)P2 is believed to generate docking sites for recruitment of cytosolic factors responsible for the control of outgoing traffic from the endosomes.

TNF-alpha interacts with two receptors, namely TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2). Activation of TNFR1 can trigger multiple signal transduction pathways inducing inflammation, proliferation, survival or cell death (Ward C et al. 1999; Micheau O and Tschopp J 2003; Widera D et al. 2006). Whether a TNF-alpha-stimulated cell will survive or die is dependent on autocrine/paracrine signals, and on the cellular context.<p>TNF binding to TNFR1 results initially in the formation of Complex I that consists of TNFR1, TRADD (TNFR1-associated death domain), TRAF2 (TNF receptor associated factor-2), RIPK1 (receptor interacting protein kinase 1), and BIRC1 and BIRC3 (cIAP1/2,cellular inhibitor of apoptosis) (Micheau O and Tschopp J 2003). This complex by default activates NFkappaB promoting cell survival (induction of anti-apoptotic proteins such as BIRC, cFLIP) and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF and IL-6). When the survival pathway is inhibited, TNF-induced signaling leads to the formation of Complex II that is made up of TRADD, FADD (Fas-associated death domain-containing protein, RIPK1,and procaspase-8 leading to the activation of caspase-8 and apoptotic cell death. When caspase activity is inhibited under certain pathophysiological conditions (e.g. caspase-8 inhibitory proteins such as CrmA and vICA after infection with  cowpox virus or CMV) or by pharmacological agents, deubiquitinated RIPK1 is physically and functionally engaged by its homolog RIPK3 leading to formation of the necrosome, a necroptosis-inducing complex consisting of RIPK1 and RIPK3 (Tewari M & Dixit VM 1995; Fliss PM & Brune W 2012; Sawai H 2013; Moquin DM et al. 2013; Kalai M et al. 2002; Cho YS et al. 2009, He S et al. 2009, Zhang DW et al., 2009).TNF-alpha can also activate sphingomyelinase (SMASE, such as SMPD2,3) proteins to catalyze hydrolysis of sphingomyeline into ceramide (Adam D et al.1996; Adam-Klages S et al. 1998; Ségui B et al. 2001). Activation of neutral SMPD2,3 leads to an accumulation of ceramide at the cell surface and has proinflammatory effects. However, TNF can also activate the pro-apoptotic  acidic SMASE via caspase-8 mediated activation of caspase-7 which in turn proteolytically cleaves and activates the 72kDa pro-A-SMase form (Edelmann B et al. 2011). Ceramide induces anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic responses. Further, ceramide can be converted by ceramidase into sphingosine, which in turn is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase into sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P exerts the opposite biological effects to ceramide by activating cytoprotective signaling to promote cell growth counteracting the apoptotic stimuli (Cuvillier O et al. 1996). Thus, TNF-alpha-induced TNFR1 activation leads to divergent intracellular signaling networks with extensive cross-talk between the pro-apoptotic pathway, and the other NFkappaB, and JNK pathways providing highly specific cell responses initiated by various types of stimuli.

    198291: '''Neurotrophin-TRK complexes can be internalized and enter signalling vesicles, which travel retrogradely over long distances from distal nerve terminals to neuronal cell bodies. Such retrograde signalling by neurotrophin-TRK complexes regulates survival, synaptogenesis and maintenance of proper neural connectivity. The neurotrophin-TRK complex may use three distinct internalization pathways. Although Clathrin-mediated endocytosys appears to be the major internalization route, it is controversial whether it also represents the dominant pathway for retrograde transport and signalling. Pyncher-mediated endocytosis might be more relevant in this regard. Moreover, also caveolin-mediated endocytosis may play a role in NGF-TrkA internalization.<br>Retrograde transport of TRKs is microtubule-dependent: TRKs remain activated and bound to neurotrophins during retrograde transport. The current view is reflected in the signalling endosome model. It is a specialized vesicle containing ligand (NGF, BDNF) bound to its activated TRK receptor, together with activated downstream signalling proteins, transported by motor proteins (dyneins) from nerve terminals to remote cell bodies, where the receptors trigger signalling cascades.''',

These molecules are known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs are immunologically silent in healthy tissues but become active upon tissue damage during both infectious and sterile insult. DAMPs are released from necrotic cells or secreted from activated cells in response to tissue damage to mediate tissue repair by promoting inflammatory responses. However, DAMPs have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), cancer, and atherosclerosis. The mechanism underlying the switch from DAMPs that initiate controlled tissue repair, to those that mediate chronic, uncontrolled inflammation is still unclear. Recent evidence suggests that an abnormal increase in protein citrullination is  involved in disease pathophysiology (Anzilotti C et al. 2010; Sanchez-Pernaute O et al. 2013; Sokolove J et al. 2011; Sharma P et al. 2012).

    431763: '''Aquaporins (AQP's) are six-pass transmembrane proteins that form channels in membranes. Each monomer contains a central channel formed in part by two asparagine-proline-alanine motifs (NPA boxes) that confer selectivity for water and/or solutes. The monomers assemble into tetramers. During passive transport by Aquaporins most aquaporins (i.e. AQP0/MIP, AQP1, AQP2, AQP3, AQP4, AQP5, AQP7, AQP8, AQP9, AQP10) transport water into and out of cells according to the osmotic gradient across the membrane. Four aquaporins (the aquaglyceroporins AQP3, AQP7,  AQP9,  AQP10) conduct glycerol, three aquaporins (AQP7, AQP9, AQP10) conduct urea, and one aquaporin (AQP6) conducts anions, especially nitrate. AQP8 also conducts ammonia in addition to water.<br>AQP11 and AQP12, classified as group III aquaporins, were identified as a result of the genome sequencing project and are characterized by having variations in the first NPA box when compared to more traditional aquaporins. Additionally, a conserved cysteine residue is present about 9 amino acids downstream from the second NPA box and this cysteine is considered indicative of group III aquaporins. Purified AQP11 incorporated into liposomes showed water transport. Knockout mice lacking AQP11 had fatal cyst formation in the proximal tubule of the kidney. Exogenously expressed AQP12 showed intracellular localization. AQP12 is expressed exclusively in pancreatic acinar cells.<br>Aquaporins are important in fluid and solute transport in various tissues.

AQP0, AQP1, AQP3, AQP4, AQP8, AQP9, and AQP11 play roles in the physiology of the hepatobiliary tract.<br>In the kidney, water and solutes are passed out of the bloodstream and into the proximal tubule via the slit-like structure formed by nephrin in the glomerulus. Water is reabsorbed from the filtrate during its transit through the proximal tubule, the descending loop of Henle, the distal convoluted tubule, and the collecting duct. Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) in the proximal tubule and the descending thin limb of Henle is responsible for about 90% of reabsorption (as estimated from mouse knockouts of AQP1). AQP1 is located on both the apical and basolateral surface of epithelial cells and thus transports water through the epithelium and back into the bloodstream. In the collecting duct epithelial cells have AQP2 on their apical surfaces and AQP3 and AQP4 on their basolateral surfaces to transport water across the epithelium. Vasopressin regulates renal water homeostasis via Aquaporins by regulating the permeability of the epithelium through activation of a signaling cascade leading to the phosphorylation of AQP2 and its translocation from intracellular vesicles to the apical membrane of collecting duct cells.<br>Here, three views of aquaporin-mediated transport have been annotated: a generic view of transport mediated by the various families of aquaporins independent of tissue type (Passive transport by Aquaporins), a view of the role of specific aquaporins in maintenance of renal water balance (Vasopressin regulates renal water homeostasis via Aquaporins), and a view of the role of specific aquaporins in glycerol transport from adipocytes to the liver (Transport of glycerol from adipocytes to the liver by Aquaporins).''',
    5637785: '''In glioblastoma, the most prevalent EGFR mutation, present in ~25% of tumors, is the deletion of the ligand binding domain of EGFR, accompanied with amplification of the mutated allele, which results in over-expression of the mutant protein known as EGFRvIII. EGFRvIII mutant is not able to bind a ligand, but dimerizes and autophosphorylates spontaneously and is therefore constitutively active (Fernandes et al. 2001). Point mutations in the extracellular domain of EGFR are also frequently found in glioblastoma, but ligand binding ability and responsiveness are preserved (Lee et al. 2006).  <br>Similar to EGFR kinase domain mutants, EGFRvIII mutant needs to maintain association with the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) for proper functioning (Shimamura et al. 2005, Lavictoire et al. 2003).

    206493: '''The Imd pathway mediates the response of Drosophila to the presence of diaminopimelic acid-type peptidoglycan (DAP-PGN) found in all Gram negative and many Gram positive bacteria, over lysine-type PGN found in Gram positive bacteria.  It operates in the fat-body and hemocytes in response to a systemic infection and is activated upon recognition of DAP-PGN by the PGRP-LC/LE receptors, which leads to activation of the NFkappaB-like transactivator Relish (REL).  Elements regulated by the pathway during a systemic infection have been identified by microarray and include a large set of antibacterial peptides genes (De Gregorio et al., 2002; Boutros et al., 2002).  In addition, the Imd pathway plays an important role in the relationship many epithelia have with the external world, where it mediates the local inducible immune response (Tzou et al., 2000; Zaidman-Remy et al., 2006).  The canonical component of the Imd pathway contains: PGRP-LC (Gottar et al., 2002; Choe et al., 2002; Ramet et al., 2002), IMD (Georgel et al., 2001), DFADD (BG4) (Leulier et al., 2002; Naitza et al., 2002), DREDD (Leulier et al., 2000), REL (Hedengren et al., 1999), Kenny (KEY) and IRD5 (Silverman et al., 2000; Rutschmann et al., 2000; Lu et al., 2001), TAK1 (Vidal et al., 2001; Silverman et al., 2003), TAB2 (Gesellchen et al., 2005; Kleino et al., 2005; Zhuang et al., 2006), Inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (IAP2) (Gesellchen et al., 2005; Kleino et al., 2005; Leulier et al., 2006).  Flies lacking these genes are viable but are highly susceptible to Gram negative bacterial infection (Lemaitre et al., 1995). It is not clear if this pathway plays another role beside immunity but overactivation of the Imd pathway induces strong lethality due to apoptosis (Georgel et al., 2001).  It should also be noted that the Imd pathway is present and functional in almost all epithelial cells.  However, the responses in these tissues are not identical to those observed in the fat body (or in cell culture).  In particular, the outputs of Imd signalling are significantly modified in the gut.  During Imd signalling in the gut, gene targets producing PGN-digesting PGRP-LB and -SC proteins are expressed but other REL target genes, especially the AMP genes are mostly silent.<br><br>In response to infection by Gram-negative bacteria the Imd pathway of the innate immunity response is activated.  DAP-PGNs, found on Gram-negative bacteria, are recognised and bind to the PGRP-LC receptor at the plasma membrane or intracellularly bind to the PGRP-LE receptor.  This causes the receptor to dimerise/multimerise and activate resulting in the recruitment of the adaptor proteins IMD and DFADD (BG4) along with the caspase 8 orthologue DREDD.  Meanwhile, the Ser/Thr MAPK kinase kinase, TAK1 and its partner TAB2 are activated possibly through the IAP2:Bendless (BEN):UEV1a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex.  TAK1 and TAB2, in turn phosphorylate the IKKbeta orthologue IRD5.  Activated IRD5, in complex with IKKgamma orthologue Kenny (KEY), phosphorylates the NFkappaB orthologue Relish (REL).  REL consists of an N-terminal nuclear factor containing domain (REL-68) and an inhibitory C-terminal domain (REL-49) responsible for anchoring REL in the cytoplasm.  REL is then cleaved by the caspase, DREDD, releasing the N-terminal domain REL-68.  This translocates to the nucleus where it is able to activate transcription of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides.<br><br>In addition to being a key component of the Imd pathway, TAK1 kinase is involved in triggering a JNK kinase signalling cascade, starting with the phosphorylation of the JNKK, Hemipterous (HEP).  This binds to a scaffolding protein, Connector of kinase to AP-1 (CKA), bringing into close proximity the JNK protein, Basket (BSK) which is phosphorylated by HEP.  CKA is also phosphorylated which results in the dissociation of BSK which translocates to the nucleus.  Here it binds with a nuclear-residing CKA molecule which additionally recruits the AP-1 transcription factor consisting of the c-Jun orthologue, JRA, and the c-Fos orthologue, Kayak (KAY).  BSK may phosphorylate both JRA and KAY which dissociate from CKA and activate transcription of genes involved in the early immune response thought to be involved in wound repair and stress mechanisms.  Additionally, the gene responsible for encoding the phosphatase Puckered (PUC) is activated which is responsible for dephosphorylating BSK, an example of a negative regulatory loop.<br><br>The Imd pathway mediates the immune response against Gram-negative bacteria infection.  During immune challenge, the JNK pathway is activated prior to the activation of the Imd pathway.  This early immune response does not require REL activity, in fact, it has been proposed that the main target of the JNK pathway activation, the AP-1 transcription factor, inhibits the activation of REL dependent genes.

The proteolytic cascade activating SPZ during dorsoventral patterning has been well delineated and involves the serine proteases: Gastrulation defective (GD); Snake (SNK); and Easter (EA), that directly cleave the full-length Spatzle (SPZ) dimer ligand.  This cascade is negatively regulated by the serpin SPN27A that acts at the level of EA (Dissing et al., 2001; LeMosy et al., 2001).  The cascades activating SPZ during the immune response are much more complex with branches involved in the sensing of Glucan found in fungi (through GNBP3) or Lysine-type peptidoglycans (PGNs) found in gram positive cocci (through PGRP-SA, GNBP1 and PGRP-SD) and via the serine protease, Persephone (PSH), in the sensing of entomopathogenic fungus via the detection of protease.  These proteolytic cascades which are not yet well characterised converge and lead to activation of Spatzle-processing enzyme (SPE) that cleave Spatzle in the hemolymph.<br><br>The processed SPZ dimer binds to the extracellular part of the Toll (TL) receptor at the plasma membrane.  This causes TL to activate and dimerise through its cytoplasmic domains.  In response to this activity, the adaptor proteins MYD88, Tube (TUB), and the Ser/Thr kinase Pelle (PLL) are recruited to the TL receptor cytoplasmic region to form the 'signalling complex'.  In addition, during dorsoventral patterning in the embryo, the zinc-finger adaptor protein, Weckle (WEK) forms an extra link between MYD88 and the TL receptor (Chen et al., 2006).  PLL is activated, autophosphorylates and recruits the DL/DIF dimer, complexed to the NF-kappaB inhibitor orthologue, Cactus (CACT) to the 'signalling complex'.  CACT is complexed to NF-kappaB orthologue dimers of either Dorsal (DL) in dorsoventral polarity and larvae immune response or Dorsal-related immunity factor, Dif (DIF), the main transcription factor in the innate immunity response.  The next stage is unclear but it is believed that PLL or an unknown kinase tentatively labelled the 'Cactus kinase' phosphorylate CACT and the DL/DIF dimer.  CACT in complex with the DL/DIF dimer dissociates from the 'signalling complex'.  The phosphorylated CACT is degraded probably by the 26S proteasome, and the now free phosphorylated DL/DIF dimer translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription of genes encoding a battery of antimicrobial peptides in the immune response or genes that organise dorsoventral patterning.''',

Conversion of D-glucono-1,5-lactone 6-phosphate to 6-phospho-D-gluconate; 3. Conversion of 6-phospho-D-gluconate to ribulose 5-phosphate, with the formation of NADPH; 4. Conversion of ribulose 5-phosphate to xylulose 5-phosphate; 5. Conversion of ribulose 5-phosphate to ribose 5-phosphate; 6. Rearrangement of ribose 5-phosphate and xylulose 5-phosphate to form sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; 7. Rearrangement of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to form erythrose  4-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate; and 8. Rearrangement of xylulose 5-phosphate and erythrose 4-phosphate to form glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.<P>The oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, reactions 1-3, generates NADPH and pentose 5-phosphate. The non-oxidative branch of the pathway, reactions 4-8, converts pentose 5-phosphate to other sugars.<P>The overall pathway can operate to generate only NADPH (glucose 6-phosphate is converted to pentose 5-phosphates, which are directed to the synthesis of fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which in turn are converted back to glucose 6-phosphate). The reactions of the non-oxidative branch can operate to generate net amounts of ribose 5-phosphate with no production of NADPH.  Net flux through this network of reactions appears to depend on the metabolic state of the cell and the nature of the biosynthetic reactions underway (Casazza and Veech 1987).<p>G6PD, the enzyme that catalyzes the first reaction of the pathway, is more extensively mutated in human populations than any other enzyme, pehaps because these mutant alleles confer malaria resistance (Luzzatto and Afolayan 1968). Mutations affecting other parts of the pathway are rare, though several have been described and studies of their effects have contributed to our understanding of the normal flux of metabolites through this network of reactions (Wamelink et al. 2008).''',

    5621432: '''Arginine vasopressin (AVP(20-28)) is a 9 amino-acid long signal peptide produced by cleavage of the precursor protein AVP in the hypothalamus. It mediates the reabsorption of water in the kidney and its synthesis and release are physiologically regulated by plasma osmolarity, blood pressure and/or blood volume. AVP(20-28) binds to vasopressin receptors AVPR1 and 2, located on the basolateral surface of the kidney collecting duct. This binding results in interaction of AVPRs with the G protein alpha-s. Following a cascade of downstream events, ultimately the water channel aquaporin 2 (AQP2) translocates from intracellular stores to the apical surface where it functions as the entry site for water reabsorption. When water balance is achieved, plasma levels of AVP(20-28) drop and AQP2 levels in the apical plasma membrane are decreased.<br><br>Mutations in AVP make it unavailable to its AVPRs in the kidney, resulting in dysregulation of water reabsorption. This can cause familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI), an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by persistent excessive thirst resulting in constant drinking (polydipsia) and passage of large volumes of urine (polyuria). In FNDI, the production and release of AVP from the posterior pituitary gland is impaired (Moeller et al. 2013). ''',
    1222329: '''The first line of defense against infectious agents involves an active recruitment of phagocytes to the site of infection. Recruited cells include polymorhonuclear (PMN) leukocytes (i.e., neutrophils) and monocytes/macrophages, which function together as innate immunity sentinels (Underhill DM & Ozinsky A 2002; Stuart LM & Ezekowitz RA 2005; Flannagan RS et al. 2012). Dendritic cells are also present, serving as important players in antigen presentation for ensuing adaptive responses (Savina A & Amigorena S 2007). These cell types are able to bind and engulf invading microbes into a membrane-enclosed vacuole - the phagosome, in a process termed phagocytosis. Phagocytosis can be defined as the receptor-mediated engulfment of particles greater than 0.5 micron in diameter. It is initiated by the cross-linking of host cell membrane receptors following engagement with their cognate ligands on the target surface (Underhill DM & Ozinsky A 2002; Stuart LM & Ezekowitz RA 2005; Flannagan RS et al. 2012). When engulfed by phagocytes, microorganisms are exposed to a number of host defense microbicidal events within the resulting phagosome. These include the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, RONS) by specialized enzymes (Fang FC et al. 2004; Kohchi C et al. 2009; Gostner JM et al. 2013; Vatansever F et al. 2013). NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex consume oxygen to produce superoxide radical anion (O2.-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Robinson et al. 2004). Induced NO synthase (iNOS) is involved in the production of NO, which is the primary source of all RNS in biological systems (Evans TG et al. 1996). The NADPH phagocyte oxidase and iNOS are expressed in both PMN and mononuclear phagocytes and both cell types have the capacity for phagosomal burst activity. However, the magnitude of ROS generation in neutrophils far exceeds that observed in macrophages (VanderVen BC et al. 2009). Macrophages are thought to produce considerably more RNS than neutrophils (Fang FC et al. 2004; Nathan & Shiloh 2000).<p>The presence of RONS characterized by a relatively low reactivity, such as H2O2, O2˙− or NO, has no deleterious effect on biological environment (Attia SM 2010; Weidinger A & and Kozlov AV 2015) Their activity is controlled by endogenous antioxidants (both enzymatic and non-enzymatic) that are induced by oxidative stress. However the relatively low reactive species can initiate a cascade of reactions to generate more damaging “secondary” species such as hydroxyl radical (•OH), singlet oxygen or peroxinitrite (Robinson JM 2008; Fang FC et al. 2004). These "secondary" RONS are extremely toxic causing irreversible damage to all classes of biomolecules (Weidinger A & and Kozlov AV 2015; Fang FC et al. 2004; Kohchi C et al. 2009; Gostner JM et al. 2013; Vatansever F et al. 2013).<p>Although macrophages and neutrophils use similar mechanisms for the internalization of targets, there are differences in how they perform phagocytosis and in the final outcome of the process (Tapper H & Grinstein S 1997; Vierira OV et al. 2002). Once formed, the phagosome undergoes an extensive maturation process whereby it develops into a microbicidal organelle able to eliminate the invading pathogen. Maturation involves re-modeling both the membrane of the phagosome and its luminal contents (Vierira OV et al. 2002). In macrophages, phagosome formation and maturation follows a series of strictly coordinated membrane fission/fusion events between the phagosome and compartments of the endo/lysosomal network gradually transforming the nascent phagosome into a phagolysosome, a degradative organelle endowed with potent microbicidal properties (Zimmerli S et al. 1996; Vierira OV et al. 2002). Neutrophils instead contain a large number of preformed granules such as azurophilic and specific granules that can rapidly fuse with phagosomes delivering antimicrobial substances (Karlsson A & Dahlgren C 2002; Naucler C et al. 2002; Nordenfelt P and Tapper H 2011). Phagosomal pH dynamics may also contribute to the maturation process by regulating membrane traffic events. The microbicidal activity of macrophages is characterized by progressive acidification of the lumen (down to pH 4–5) by the proton pumping vATPase. A low pH is a prerequisite for optimal enzymatic activity of most late endosomal/lysosomal hydrolases reported in macrophages. Neutrophil phagosome pH regulation differs significantly from what is observed in macrophages (Nordenfelt P and Tapper H 2011; Winterbourn CC et al. 2016). The massive activation of the oxidative burst is thought to result in early alkalization of neutrophil phagosomes which is linked to proton consumption during the generation of hydrogen peroxide (Segal AW et al. 1981; Levine AP et al. 2015). Other studies showed that neutrophil phagosome maintained neutral pH values before the pH gradually decreased (Jankowski A et al. 2002). Neutrophil phagosomes also exhibited a high proton leak, which was initiated upon activation of the NADPH oxidase, and this activation counteracted phagosomal acidification (Jankowski A et al. 2002).<p>The Reactome module describes ROS and RNS production by phagocytic cells. The module includes cell-type specific events, for example, myeloperoxidase (MPO)-mediated production of hypochlorous acid in neutrophils. It also highlights differences between phagosomal pH dynamics in neutrophils and macrophages. The module describes microbicidal activity of selective RONS such as hydroxyl radical or peroxynitrite however the mechanisms by which reactive oxygen/nitrogen species kill pathogens is still a matter of debate.''',

    2500301: '''While sister chromatids resolve in prometaphase, separating along chromosomal arms, the cohesion of sister centromeres persists until anaphase. At the anaphase onset, the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitinates PTTG1 (securin), targeting it for degradation (Hagting et al. 2002). PTTG1 acts as an inhibitor of ESPL1 (known as separin i.e. separase). Hence, PTTG1 removal initiated by APC/C, enables ESPL1 to become catalytically active (Zou et al. 1999, Waizenegger et al. 2002). ESPL1 undergoes autoleavage (Waizenegger et al. 2002) and also cleaves RAD21 subunit of centromeric cohesin (Hauf et al. 2001). RAD21 cleavage promotes dissociation of cohesin complexes from sister centromeres, leading to separation of sister chromatids. Subsequent movement of sister chromatids to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle segregates replicated chromosomes to two daughter cells (Waizenegger et al. 2000, Hauf et al. 2001, Waizenegger et al. 2002).''',

CP is essential for SLC40A1 (ferroportin) stability at the cell surface, the protein that mediates iron efflux from cells. CP also possesses ferroxidase activity, which oxidises ferrous iron (Fe2+) to ferric iron (Fe3+) following its transfer out of the cell.

    5686999: '''MAPK6 and MAPK4 (also known as ERK3 and ERK4) are vertebrate-specific atypical MAP kinases.  Atypical MAPK are less well characterized than their conventional counterparts, and are generally classified as such based on their lack of activation by MAPKK family members. Unlike the conventional MAPK proteins, which contain a Thr-X-Tyr motif in the activation loop, MAPK6 and 4 have a single Ser-Glu-Gly phospho-acceptor motif (reviewed in Coulombe and Meloche, 2007; Cargnello et al, 2011).  MAPK6 is also distinct in being an unstable kinase, whose turnover is mediated by ubiquitin-dependent degradation (Coulombe et al, 2003; Coulombe et al, 2004). The biological functions and pathways governing MAPK6 and 4 are not well established.  MAPK6 and 4 are phosphorylated downstream of class I p21 activated kinases (PAKs) in a RAC- or CDC42-dependent manner (Deleris et al, 2008; Perander et al, 2008; Deleris et al, 2011; De La Mota-Peynado et al, 2011). One of the only well established substrates of MAPK6 and 4 is MAPKAPK5, which contributes to cell motility by promoting the HSBP1-dependent rearrangement of F-actin (Gerits et al, 2007; Kostenko et al, 2009a; reviewed in Kostenko et al, 2011b).

Although most of the genes encoding proteins of the chicken TLR cascade molecules have not been cloned and characterized directly, analyses of the chicken genome sequence has defined ten TLRs [Lynn et al. 2003, Temperley ND et al. 2008]. The avian TLR repertoire consists of single orthologs of mammalian TLRs 3, 4, 5 and 7 and distinct new chicken genes TLR15 and TLR21. The TLR2 subfamily is represented by tandemly duplicated avian TLR2 and TLR1 genes  and consists of two isoforms of each gene - TLR2 type1 and 2, TLR1 type1 and 2. No functional orthologs of mammalian TLR8, TLR9 and TLR10 have been detected in the chicken genome.  However, chicken heterophils and spleen cells are responsive to the broad range of mammalian TLR antagonists including ligands that stimulate mammalian TLR7/8 and TLR9 [Schwarz et al. 2007, He et al. 2006, Kogut et al. 2007].<p>TLR signaling pathways are highly conserved among vertebrates and the chicken proteins involved in the TLR signaling cascade show moderate to high identity with their human counterparts [Yilmaz et al. 2005, Temperley et al. 2008, Cormican et al. 2009]. Thus, a homology-based strategy was used to reconstruct most parts of the chicken TLR pathways in this Reactome module.<p>All TLRs share a similar structure consisting of N-terminus ectodomain with several leucine-rich regions (LRR), one or two trans-membrane domains and an intracellular C-terminus Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor domain (TIR).<p>Activation of TLR pathways occurs upon recognition and interaction with conserved motifs expressed by invading microbes, also known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Each TLR recognizes specific PAMPs.</p>Upon PAMP binding TLRs form heterodimers (TLR2 subfamily) or homodimers (all other TLRs). Activated TLRs recruit one or several TIR adaptor proteins myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), TIR domain containing adaptor protein (TIRAP or MAL), TIR domain-containing adapter protein inducing IFN-beta (TRIF or TIKAM-1), and TRIF related adaptor molecule (TRAM). The fifth known adaptor SARM binds TIR as a negative competitor to TRIF.<p>All TLRs except TLR3 can initiate downstream  signaling through MyD88 adaptor protein. In the MyD88-dependent pathway, once the adaptor is bound to TLR, it leads to recruitment of IL1 receptor associated kinase family  IRAK, followed by activation of tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). TRAF6 is an ubiquitin E3 ligase, which in turn induces TGF-beta activating kinase 1 (TAK1) autophosphorylation. Once activated, TAK1 can ultimately mediate the induction of the transcription factor NF-kB or the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), such as JNK, p38 and ERK. This results in the translocation of the activated NF-kB and MAPKs to the nucleus and the initiation of appropriate gene transcription leading to the production of many proinflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides.<p>In contrast to other TLRs, TLR3 functions only through the MyD88-independent signaling cascade, recruiting TRIF, which in turn leads to the interferon regulatory factor 3 or 7 (IRF3/7) activation.  Activated IRF3 or 7 mediates innate anti-viral responses through interferon-beta expression.<p> Mammalian TLR4 can ultimately utilize both MyD88-dependent (controlled by the MyD88-TIRAP pair of adaptors)  and MyD88-independent (controlled by TRAM-TRIF adaptor proteins) signaling pathways, in contrast, chicken TLR4 signaling is mediated by MyD88-TIRAP exlusively.''',

Finally, acetate in the mitochondrion can be condensed with coenzyme A to form acetyl CoA. Polymorphisms in the enzymes catalyzing the first two steps are associated with variation in the efficiency of alcohol catabolism in human populations (Chen et al. 1999; Lange et al. 1976; Jornvall 1985).

The NADH and FADH2 are then oxidized by the electron transport chain to yield nine more high-energy phosphate bonds (as ATP). All reactions of the citric acid cycle take place in the mitochondrion.<p>Eight canonical reactions mediate the synthesis of citrate from acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate and the metabolism of citrate to re-form oxaloacetate. Six additional reactions are included here. Three reversible reactions, the interconversions of citrate and isocitrate, of fumarate and malate, and of malate and oxaloacetate are annotated in both their canonical (forward) and reverse directions. The synthesis of succinate from succinyl-CoA can be coupled to the phosphorylation of either GDP (the canonical reaction) or ADP; both reactions are annotated. Two mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase isozymes catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to form alpha-ketoglutarate (2-oxoglutarate): IDH3 catalyzes the canonical reaction coupled to the reduction of NAD+, while IDH2 catalyzes the same reaction coupled to reduction of NADP+, a reaction whose normal physiological function is unclear. Both reactions are annotated. Finally, a reaction is annotated in which reducing equivalents are transferred from NADPH to NAD+ coupled to proton import across the inner mitochondrial membrane.<p>The cyclical nature of the reactions responsible for the oxidation of acetate was first suggested by Hans Krebs, from biochemical studies of pigeon breast muscle (Krebs et al. 1938; Krebs and Eggleston 1940). Many of the molecular details of individual reactions were worked out by Ochoa and colleagues, largely through studies of enzymes purified from pig heart (Ochoa 1980).

In the early stages of the viral life cycle, or in the absence of the viral Rev protein, completely spliced viral mRNA which encode the regulatory proteins Tat, Nef and Rev are exported from the nucleus while the incompletely spliced structural protein encoding transcripts are held within the nucleus by cellular proteins that normally function in preventing the nuclear export of cellular pre-mRNA.  Export of both unspliced and partially spliced mRNA is mediated by the viral protein Rev which is recruited, along with cellular cofactors, to the Rev Response Element (RRE) within the HIV-1 mRNA sequence (Malim et al., 1990; Fischer et al., 1994).

Biliary phospholipids associate with bile salts and cholesterol in mixed micelles, thereby reducing the detergent activity and cytotoxicity of bile salts and preventing cholesterol crystallisation. Thus, ABCB4 plays a crucial role in bile formation and lipid homeostasis. Defects in ABCB4 result in a wide spectrum of cholestasis phenotypes, from progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis 3 (PFIC3; MIM:602347) and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy 3 (ICP3; MIM:614972) to gallbladder disease 1 (GBD1; MIM:600803) (Jacquemin et al. 2001, Davit-Spraul et al. 2010, Jacquemin 2012).

The truncated NOTCH1 contains amino acids 1580 to 2555 of the wild-type NOTCH1, lacking almost the entire extracellular domain, including EGF and LIN12 repeats (Ellisen et al. 1991). As EGF repeats are needed for NOTCH1 interaction with its ligands (DLL1, DLL4, JAG1, JAG2), the mutant NOTCH1 t(7;9)(NOTCH1:M1580_K2555) does not bind a ligand.

This process is strictly regulated by the Ca2+ concentration gradient in the epidermis (Esholtz et al. 2014). Loricrin and involucrin are encoded in ‘Epidermal Differentiation Complex’ linked to a large number of genes encoding nonredundant components of the CE (Kypriotou et al. 2012, Niehues et al. 2016). Keratinocytes produce specialized proteins and lipids which are used to construct the cornified envelope (CE), a heavily crosslinked submembranous layer that confers rigidity to the upper epidermis, allows keratin filaments to attach to any location in the cell membrane (Kirfel et al. 2003) and acts as a water-impermeable barrier. The CE has two functional parts: covalently cross-linked proteins (10 nm thick) that comprise the backbone of the envelope and covalently linked lipids (5 nm thick) that coat the exterior (Eckert et al. 2005). Desmosomal components are crosslinked to the CE to form corneodesmosomes, which bind cornified cells together (Ishida-Yamamoto et al. 2011). Mature terminally differentiated cornified cells consist mostly of keratin filaments covalently attached to the CE embedded in lipid lamellae (Kalinin et al. 2002). The exact composition of the cornified envelope varies between epithelia (Steinert et al. 1998); the relative amino-acid composition of the proteins used may determine differential mechanical properties (Kartasova et al. 1996).''',

    444239: '''NMDA receptors are a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors that are specifically activated by a glutamate agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). Activation of NMDA receptors involves opening of the ion channel that allows the influx of Ca2+. NMDA receptors are central to activity dependent changes in synaptic strength and are predominantly involved in the synaptic plasticity that pertains to learning and memory. A unique feature of NMDA receptors, unlike other glutamate receptors, is the requirement for dual activation, both voltage-dependent and ligand-dependent activation. The ligand-dependent activation of NMDA receptors requires co-activation by two ligands, glutamate and glycine. However, at resting membrane potential, the pore of ligand-bound NMDA receptors is blocked by Mg2+. The voltage dependent Mg2+ block is relieved upon depolarization of the post-synaptic membrane. NMDA receptors are coincidence detectors, and are activated only if there is a simultaneous activation of both pre- and post-synaptic cell. Upon activation, NMDA receptors allow the influx of Ca2+ that initiates various molecular signaling cascades involved in the processes of learning and memory.

    5683030: '''The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway regulates processes such as proliferation, differentiation, survival, senescence and cell motility in response to growth factors, hormones and cytokines, among others. Binding of these stimuli to receptors in the plasma membrane promotes the GEF-mediated activation of RAS at the plasma membrane and initiates the three-tiered kinase cascade of the conventional MAPK cascades.  GTP-bound RAS recruits RAF (the MAPK kinase kinase), and promotes its dimerization and activation (reviewed in Cseh et al, 2014; Roskoski, 2010; McKay and Morrison, 2007; Wellbrock et al, 2004).  Activated RAF phosphorylates the MAPK kinase proteins MEK1 and MEK2 (also known as MAP2K1 and MAP2K2), which in turn phophorylate the proline-directed kinases ERK1 and 2 (also known as MAPK3 and MAPK1) (reviewed in Roskoski, 2012a, b; Kryiakis and Avruch, 2012).  Activated ERK proteins may undergo dimerization and have identified targets in both the nucleus and the cytosol; consistent with this, a proportion of activated ERK protein relocalizes to the nucleus in response to stimuli (reviewed in Roskoski 2012b; Turjanski et al, 2007; Plotnikov et al, 2010; Cargnello et al, 2011).  Although initially seen as a linear cascade originating at the plasma membrane and culminating in the nucleus, the RAS/RAF MAPK cascade is now also known to be activated from various intracellular location.  Temporal and spatial specificity of the cascade is achieved in part through the interaction of pathway components with numerous scaffolding proteins (reviewed in McKay and Morrison, 2007; Brown and Sacks, 2009). <br> The importance of the RAS/RAF MAPK cascade is highlighted by the fact that components of this pathway are mutated with high frequency in a large number of human cancers.

CD209 interacts with different mannose-expressing pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV-1 (Gringhuis et al. 2007, Geijtenbeek et al. 2000a). It also acts as an adhesion receptor that interacts with ICAM2 (intracellular adhesion molecule-2) on endothelial cells and ICAM3 on T cells (Geijtenbeek et al. 2000b,c). 
CD209 functions not only as an independent PRR, but is also implicated in the modulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling at the level of the transcription factor NF-kB (Gringhuis et al. 2009). CLEC7A (Dectin-1) and CD209 (DC-SIGN) signalling modulates Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling through the kinase RAF1 that is independent of the SYK pathway but integrated with it at the level of NF-kB activation. The activation of RAF1 by CLEC7A or CD209 does not lead to activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1)/2 or Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1)/2 but leads to the phosphorylation and subsequent acetylation of RELA (p65). RELA phosphorylated on S276 not only positively regulates the activity of p65 through acetylation of p65, but also represses RELB activity by sequestering active RELB into inactive p65-RELB dimers that do not bind DNA (Gringhuis et al. 2007, Svajger et al. 2010, Jacque et al. 2005). RAF1-dependent signaling pathway is crucial in dectin-1 mediated immunity as it modulates both the canonical (promoting p65 phosphorylation and acetylation) and non-canonical (forming inactive p65-RELB dimers) NK-kB activation.''',

Senescent cells accumulate in aged tissues (reviewed by Campisi 1997 and Lopez-Otin 2013), which may be due to an increased senescence rate and/or decrease in the rate of clearance of senescent cells. In a mouse model of accelerated aging, clearance of senescent cells delays the onset of age-related phenotypes (Baker et al. 2011).<p>Cellular senescence can be triggered by the aberrant activation of oncogenes or loss-of-function of tumor suppressor genes, and this type of senescence is known as the oncogene-induced senescence, with RAS signaling-induced senescence being the best studied. Oxidative stress, which may or may not be caused by oncogenic RAS signaling, can also trigger senescence. Finally,  the cellular senescence program can be initiated by DNA damage, which may be caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative stress, and by telomere shortening caused by replicative exhaustion which may be due to oncogenic signaling. The senescent phenotype was first reported by Hayflick and Moorhead in 1961, when they proposed replicative senescence as a mechanism responsible for the cessation of mitotic activity and morphological changes that occur in human somatic diploid cell strains as a consequence of serial passaging, preventing the continuous culture of untransformed cells-the Hayflick limit (Hayflick and Moorhead 1961).<p> Secreted proteins that constitute the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), also known as the senescence messaging secretome (SMS), include inflammatory and immune-modulatory cytokines, growth factors, shed cell surface molecules and survival factors.

The MAPK kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), at the top of the cascade, is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues in response to external stimuli; this phosphorylation often occurs in the context of an interaction between the MAPKKK protein and a member of the RAS/RHO family of small GTP-binding proteins.

    350071: '''<b>THE NOTCH-HLH TRANSCRIPTION PATHWAY:</b>  <br><br>
Notch signaling was first identified in Drosophila, where it has been studied in detail at the genetic, molecular, biochemical and cellular levels (reviewed in Justice, 2002; Bray, 2006; Schweisguth, 2004; Louvri, 2006).  In Drosophila, Notch signaling to the nucleus is thought always to be mediated by one specific DNA binding transcription factor, Suppressor of Hairless.  In mammals, the homologous genes are called CBF1 (or RBPJkappa), while in worms they are called Lag-1, so that the acronym "CSL" has been given to this conserved transcription factor family.  There are at least two human CSL homologues, which are now named RBPJ and RBPJL.<br><br>CSL is an example of a bifunctional DNA-binding transcription factor that mediates repression of specific target genes in one context, but activation of the same targets in another context.  This bifunctionality is mediated by the association of specific Co-Repressor complexes vs. specific Co-Activator complexes in different contexts, namely in the absence or presence of Notch signaling.<br><br>In Drosophila, Su(H) represses target gene transcription in the absence of Notch signaling, but activates target genes during Notch signaling.  At least some of the mammalian CSL homologues are believed also to be bifunctional, and to mediate target gene repression in the absence of Notch signaling, and activation in the presence of Notch signaling.<br><br>Notch Co-Activator and Co-Repressor complexes: This repression is mediated by at least one specific co-repressor complexes (Co-R) bound to CSL in the absence of Notch signaling.  In Drosophila, this co-repressor complex consists of at least three distinct co-repressor proteins: Hairless, Groucho, and dCtBP (Drosophila C-terminal Binding Protein).  Hairless has been show to bind directly to Su(H), and Groucho and dCtBP have been shown to bind directly to Hairless (Barolo, 2002).  All three of the co-repressor proteins have been shown to be necessary for proper gene regulation during Notch signaling in vivo (Nagel, 2005).<br><br>In mammals, the same general pathway and mechanisms are observed, where CSL proteins are bifunctional DNA binding transcription factors (TFs), that bind to Co-Repressor complexes to mediate repression in the absence of Notch signaling, and bind to Co-Activator  complexes to mediate activation in the presence of Notch signaling.  However, in mammals, there may be multiple co-repressor complexes, rather than the single Hairless co-repressor complex that has been observed in Drosophila.  <br><br>During Notch signaling in all systems, the Notch transmembrane receptor is cleaved and the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) translocates to the nucleus, where it there functions as a specific transcription co-activator for CSL proteins.  In the nucleus, NICD replaces the Co-R complex bound to CSL, thus resulting in de-repression of  Notch target genes in the nucleus.  Once bound to CSL, NICD and CSL proteins recruit an additional co-activator protein, Mastermind, to form a CSL-NICD-Mam ternary co-activator (Co-A) complex.  This Co-A complex was initially thought to be sufficient to mediate activation of  at least some Notch target genes.  However, there now is evidence that still other co-activators and additional DNA-binding transcription factors are required in at least some contexts (reviewed in Barolo, 2002).<br><br>Mammalian CSL Corepressor Complexes: In the absence of activated Notch signaling, DNA-bound CSL proteins recruit a corepressor complex to maintain target genes in the repressed state until Notch is specifically activated. The mammalian corepressor complexes include NCOR complexes, but may also include additional corepressor proteins, such as SHARP (reviewed in Mumm, 2000 and Kovall, 2007). The exact composition of the CSL NCOR complex is not known, but in other pathways the "core" NCOR corepressor complex includes at least one NCOR protein (NCOR1, NCOR2, CIR), one Histone Deacetylase protein (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, etc), and one TBL1 protein (TBL1X, TBL1XR1) (reviewed in Rosenfeld, 2006). In some contexts, the core NCOR corepressor complex may also recruit additional corepressor proteins or complexes, such as the SIN3 complex, which consists of SIN3 (SIN3A, SIN3B), and SAP30, or other SIN3-associated proteins. An additional CSL - NCOR binding corepressor, SHARP, may also contribute to the CSL corepressor complex in some contexts (Oswald, 2002). The CSL corepressor complex also includes a bifunctional cofactor, SKIP, that is present in both CSL corepressor complexes and CSL coactivator complexes, and may function in the binding of NICD and displacement of the corepressor complex during activated Notch signaling (Zhou, 2000).<br><br>Mammalian CSL Coactivator Complexes: Upon activation of Notch signaling, cleavage of the transmembrane Notch receptor releases the Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to CSL and displaces the corepressor complex from CSL (reviewed in Mumm, 2000 and Kovall, 2007). The resulting CSL-NICD "binary complex" then recruits an additional coactivator, Mastermind (Mam), to form a ternary complex. The ternary complex then recruits additional, more general coactivators, such as CREB Binding Protein (CBP), or the related p300 coactivator, and a number of Histone Acetytransferase (HAT) proteins, including GCN5 and PCAF (Fryer, 2002). There is evidence that Mam also can subsequently recruit specific kinases that phosphorylate NICD, to downregulate its function and turn off Notch signaling (Fryer, 2004).<br><br>Combinatorial Complexity in Transcription Cofactor Complexes: HDAC9 has at least 7 splice isoforms, with some having distinct interaction and functional properties. Isoforms 6 and 7 interact with NCOR1. Isoforms 1 and 4 interact with MEF2 (Sparrow, 1999), which is a specific DNA-binding cofactor for a subset of HLH proteins. Isoform 3 interacts with both NCOR1 and MEF2. Although many HDACs only have one or two isoforms, this complexity for HDAC9 illustrates the level of transcript complexity and functional specificity that such "general" transcriptional cofactors can have.''',
    3000184: '''Syndecans are type I transmembrane proteins, with an N-terminal ectodomain that contains several consensus sequences for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Syndecan-1 and -3 GAG attachment sites occur in two distinct clusters, one near the N-terminus and the other near the membrane-attachment site, separated by a proline and threonine-rich 'spacer'. Syndecan ectodomain sequences are poorly conserved in the family and between species, but the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are highly conserved. Syndecan-1 and -3 form a subfamily. Syndecan core proteins form dimers (Choi et al. 2007) and at least syndecan-3 and -4 form oligomers (Asundi & Carey 1995, Shin et al. 2012).  Syndecan-1 is the major syndecan of epithelial cells including vascular endothelium. Syndecan-2 is present mostly in mesenchymal, neuronal and smooth muscle cells. Syndecan-3 is the major syndecan of the nervous system, while syndecan-4 is ubiquitously expressed but at lower levels than the other syndecans (refs in Alexopoulou et al. 2007). The core syndecan protein has three to five heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate chains, which interact with a variety of ligands including fibroblast growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, fibronectin, collagen, vitronectin and several integrins. Syndecans may act as integrin coreceptors. Interactions between fibronectin and syndecans are modulated by tenascin-C. 

Syndecans bind a wide variety of soluble and insoluble ligands, inckluding extracellular matrix components, cell adhesion molecules, growth factors, cytokines, and proteinases. As the cleaved ectodomains of syndecans retain the ability to bind ligands, ectodomain shedding is a mechanism for releasing soluble effectors that may compete for ligands with their cell-bound counterparts (Kainulainen et al. 1998). Shed  ectodomains are found in inflammatory fluids (Subramanian et al. 1997) and may induce the proliferation of cancer cells (Maeda et al. 2004). ''',

It is strongly induced upon exposure to type I Interferons (IFNs), viruses, bacterial LPS, and other stresses. Once released the mature ISG15 conjugates with an array of target proteins, a process termed ISGylation. ISGylation utilizes a mechanism similar to ubiquitination, requiring a three-step enzymatic cascade. UBE1L is the ISG15 E1 activating enzyme which specifically activates ISG15 at the expense of ATP. ISG15 is then transfered from E1 to the E2 conjugating enzyme UBCH8 and then to the target protein with the aid of an ISG15 E3 ligase, such as HERC5 and EFP. Hundreds of target proteins for ISGylation have been identified. Several proteins that are part of antiviral signaling pathways, such as RIG-I, MDA5, Mx1, PKR, filamin B, STAT1, IRF3 and JAK1, have been identified as targets for ISGylation. ISG15 also conjugates some viral proteins, inhibiting viral budding and release.

Gluconeogenesis is confined to cells of the liver and kidney and enables glucose synthesis from molecules such as lactate and alanine and other amino acids when exogenous glucose is not available. The process of gluconeogenesis as diagrammed below occurs in two parts: a network of possible reactions mediates the conversion of mitochondrial pyruvate to cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate, which in turn is converted to glucose 6-phosphate in a single sequence of cytosolic reactions.<p>In the chicken, three variants of the process can be distinguished, two restricted to the kidney and one that takes place in both kidney and liver. 1) In the kidney, carbon atoms from mitochondrial oxaloacetate, via a series of transport and transamination reactions, are used to generate cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate by a cytosolic, hormonally regulated form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, PCK1. This variant allows regulated glucose synthesis from lactate. 2) In the kidney, mitochondrial oxaloacetate is reduced to malate, which is exported to the cytosol and re-oxidized to oxaloacetate. This variant provides reducing equivalents to the cytosol, needed for glucose synthesis from amino acids such as alanine and glutamine. 3) In both liver and kidney, constitutively expressed mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, PCK2, catalyzes the conversion of mitochondrial oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate which in turn is transported to the cytosol. This third variant also allows glucose synthesis from lactate (Soling et al. 1973; Wallace and Newsholme 1967; Watford et al. 1981; Weldon et al. 1990).<p>In all cases, the metabolism of a molecule of pyruvate requires the generation and consumption of one reducing equivalent as cytosolic NADH + H+. For pyruvate derived from lactate (variants 1 and 3), NADH + H+ is generated with the oxidation of lactate to pyruvate in the cytosol (a reaction of pyruvate metabolism not shown in the diagram). For pyruvate derived from amino acids (variant 2), mitochondrial NADH + H+ generated by glutamate dehydrogenase (a reaction of amino acid metabolism, not shown) is used to reduce oxaloacetate to malate, which is transported to the cytosol and re-oxidized, generating cytosolic NADH + H+.

About 95% of the bile salts in the intestine are recovered and returned to the liver (Kullak-Ublick et al. 2004; Trauner and Boyer 2002). The major pathway for bile salt synthesis in the liver begins with the conversion of cholesterol to 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol. Bile salt synthesis can also begin with the synthesis of an oxysterol - 24-hydroxycholesterol or 27-hydroxycholesterol. In the body, the initial steps of these two pathways occur in extrahepatic tissues, generating intermediates that are transported to the liver and converted to bile salts via the 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol pathway.

Oncogene-induced senescence can also be triggered by high transcriptional activity of E2F1, E2F2 or E2F3 which can be caused, for example, by the loss-of-function of RB1 tumor suppressor.<br><br>Oncogenic signals trigger transcription of CDKN2A locus tumor suppressor genes: p16-INK4A and p14-ARF. p16-INK4A and p14-ARF share exons 2 and 3, but are expressed from different promoters and use different reading frames (Quelle et al. 1995). Therefore, while their mRNAs are homologous and are both translationally inhibited by miR-24 microRNA (Lal et al. 2008, To et al. 2012), they share no similarity at the amino acid sequence level and perform distinct functions in the cell. p16-INK4A acts as the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 which phosphorylate and inhibit RB1 protein thereby promoting G1 to S transition and cell cycle progression (Serrano et al. 1993). Increased p16-INK4A level leads to hypophosphorylation of RB1, allowing RB1 to inhibit transcription of E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3-target genes that are needed for cell cycle progression, which results in cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. p14-ARF binds and destabilizes MDM2 ubiquitin ligase (Zhang et al. 1998), responsible for ubiquitination and degradation of TP53 (p53) tumor suppressor protein (Wu et al. 1993, Fuchs et al. 1998, Fang et al. 2000). Therefore, increased p14-ARF level leads to increased level of TP53 and increased expression of TP53 target genes, such as p21, which triggers p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and, depending on other factors, may also lead to p53-mediated apoptosis. CDKN2B locus, which encodes an inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6, p15-INK4B, is located in the vicinity of CDKN2A locus, at the chromosome band 9p21. p15-INK4B, together with p16-INK4A, contributes to senescence of human T-lymphocytes (Erickson et al. 1998) and mouse fibroblasts (Malumbres et al. 2000). SMAD3, activated by TGF-beta-1 signaling, controls senescence in the mouse multistage carcinogenesis model through regulation of MYC and p15-INK4B gene expression (Vijayachandra et al. 2003). TGF-beta-induced p15-INK4B expression is also important for the senescence of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (Senturk et al. 2010).<p>MAP kinases MAPK1 (ERK2) and MAPK3 (ERK1), which are activated by RAS signaling, phosphorylate ETS1 and ETS2 transcription factors in the nucleus (Yang et al. 1996, Seidel et al. 2002, Foulds et al. 2004, Nelson et al. 2010). Phosphorylated ETS1 and ETS2 are able to bind RAS response elements (RREs) in the CDKN2A locus and stimulate p16-INK4A transcription (Ohtani et al. 2004). At the same time, activated ERKs (MAPK1 i.e. ERK2 and MAPK3 i.e. ERK1) phosphorylate ERF, the repressor of ETS2 transcription, which leads to translocation of ERF to the cytosol and increased transcription of ETS2 (Sgouras et al. 1995, Le Gallic et al. 2004). ETS2 can be sequestered and inhibited by binding to ID1, resulting in inhibition of p16-INK4A transcription (Ohtani et al. 2004).<br><br>Transcription of p14-ARF is stimulated by binding of E2F transcription factors (E2F1, E2F2 or E2F3) in complex with SP1 to p14-ARF promoter (Parisi et al. 2002).<br><br>Oncogenic RAS signaling affects mitochondrial metabolism through an unknown mechanism, leading to increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggers oxidative stress induced senescence pathway.

    354186: '''At the sites of vascular injury bioactive molecules such as thrombin, ADP, collagen, fibrinogen and thrombospondin are generated, secreted or exposed. These stimuli activate platelets, converting the major platelet integrin alphaIIbbeta3 from a resting state to an active conformation, in a process termed integrin priming or 'inside-out signalling'. Integrin activation refers to the change required to enhance ligand-binding activity. The activated alphaIIbbeta3 interacts with the fibrinogen and links platelets together in an aggregate to form a platelet plug. AlphaIIbbeta3 bound to fibrin generates more intracellular signals (outside-in signalling), causing further platelet activation and platelet-plug retraction. <br>In the resting state the alpha and beta tails are close together.  This interaction keeps the membrane proximal regions in a bent conformation that maintains alphaIIbbeta3 in a low affinity state. <br>Integrin alphaIIbbeta3 is released from its inactive state by interaction with the protein talin. Talin interacts with the beta3 cytoplasmic domain and disrupts the salt bridge between the alpha and beta chains. This separation in the cytoplasmic regions triggers the conformational change in the extracellular domain that increases its affinity to fibrinogen. <br>Much of talin exists in an inactive cytosolic pool, and the Rap1 interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) is implicated in talin activation and translocation to beta3 integrin cytoplasmic domain.<br>''',

Transported substances are enclosed in the vesicle lumen or located in the vesicle membrane. The transport process begins with the formation of the vesicle itself, often triggered by the interaction of the cargo with the vesicle formation machinery. Vesicular transport pathways can include vesicle formation, coating, budding, uncoating and target membrane fusion depending upon the function of the pathway described. Vesicle-mediated transport occurs from within cell via ER and Golgi transport, as well as functioning in the endocytosis of material taken into the cell via scavenger receptors.''',

Studies of genetic defects associated with maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) has provided direct insight into these processes as they take place in humans (Fajans et al. 2001). During embryogenesis, committed epithelial cells from the early pancreatic buds differentiate into mature endocrine and exocrine cells. It is helpful to schematize this process into four consecutive cellular stages, to begin to describe the complex interplay of signal transduction pathways and transcriptional networks. The annotations here are by no means complete - factors in addition to the ones described here must be active, and even for the ones that are described, only key examples of their regulatory effects and interactions have been annotated.<p>It is also important to realize that in the human, unlike the mouse, cells of the different stages can be present simultaneously in the developing pancreas and the linear representation of these developmental events shown here is an over-simplification of the actual developmental process (e.g., Sarkar et al. 2008).<p>The first stage of this process involves the predifferentiated epithelial cells of the two pancreatic anlagen that arise from the definitive endoderm at approximately somite stages 11-15 and undergo budding from somite stages 20-22. This period corresponds to gestational days 8.75-9.5 in the mouse, and 26 in the human.<p>Pancreatic buds subsequently coalesce to form a single primitive gland, while concomitantly a ductal tree lined by highly proliferative epithelial cells is formed. A subset of such epithelial cells is thought to differentiate into either endocrine or acinar exocrine cells. A third cellular stage is defined by the endocrine-committed progenitors that selectively express the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor NEUROG3. NEUROG3 is known to activate a complex transcriptional network that is essential for the specification of endocrine cells. Many transcription factors that are activated by NEUROG3 are also involved in islet-subtype cellular specification and in subsequent stages of differentiation of endocrine cells. This transient cellular stage thus leads to the generation of all known pancreatic endocrine cells, including insulin-producing beta-cells, and glucagon-producing alpha cells, the final stage of this schematic developmental process.<p>The diagram below summarizes interactions that take place between transcription factors and transcription factor target genes during these cellular stages, and shows cases where there is both functional evidence that a transcription factor is required for the target gene to be expressed, and biochemical evidence that this interaction is direct. We also describe instances where a signaling pathway is known to regulate a transcription factor gene in this process, even if the intervening signaling pathway is not fully understood.''',

The increase in K+ increases the negative membrane potential of the cell thereby hyper polarizing the cell which inhibits the release of neurotransmitters. The decrease in Ca2+ also inhibits neurotransmitter in two ways; first by preventing the fusion of synaptic vesicles containing the neurotransmitter with the plasma membrane and second by decreasing the Ca2+ dependent recruitment of synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane.

GABA A receptors are fast-acting ligand gated chloride ion channels that mediate membrane depolarization and thus inhibit neurotransmitter release (G Michels et al Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol 42, 2007, 3-14). GABA B receptors are slow acting metabotropic Gprotein coupled receptors that act via the inhibitory action of their Galpha/Go subunits on adenylate cyclase to attenuate the actions of PKA. In addition, their Gbeta/gamma subunits interact directly with N and P/Q Ca2+ channels to decrease the release of Ca2+. GABA B receptors also interact with Kir3 K+ channels and increase the influx of K+, leading to cell membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of channels such as NMDA receptors (A Pinard et al Adv Pharmacol, 58, 2010, 231-55).

    386971: '''A classic example of bifunctional transcription factors is the family of Nuclear Receptor (NR) proteins.  These are DNA-binding transcription factors that bind certain hormones, vitamins, and other small, diffusible signaling molecules.  The non-liganded NRs recruit specific corepressor complexes of the NCOR/SMRT type, to mediate transcriptional repression of the target genes to which they are bound.  During signaling, ligand binding to a specific domain the NR proteins induces a conformational change that results in the exchange of the associated CoR complex, and its replacement by a specific coactivator complex of the TRAP / DRIP / Mediator type.  These coactivator complexes typically nucleate around a MED1 coactivator protein that is directly bound to the NR transcription factor.<p>A general feature of the 49 human NR proteins is that in the unliganded state, they each bind directly to an NCOR corepressor protein, either NCOR1 or NCOR2 (NCOR2 was previously named "SMRT").  This NCOR protein nucleates the assembly of additional, specific corepressor proteins, depending on the cell and DNA context.  The NR-NCOR interaction is mediated by a specific protein interaction domain (PID) present in the NRs that binds to specific cognate PID(s) present in the NCOR proteins.  Thus, the human NRs each take part in an NR-NCOR binding reaction in the absence of binding by their ligand.<p>A second general feature of the NR proteins is that they each contain an additional, but different PID that mediates specific binding interactions with MED1 proteins.  In the ligand-bound state, NRs each take part in an NR-MED1 binding reaction to form an NR-MED1 complex.  The bound MED1 then functions to nucleate the assembly of additional specific coactivator proteins, depending on the cell and DNA context, such as what specific target gene promoter they are bound to, and in what cell type.<p>The formation of specific MED1-containing coactivator complexes on specific NR proteins has been well-characterized for a number of the human NR proteins (see Table 1 in (Bourbon, 2004)).  For example, binding of thyroid hormone (TH) to the human TH Receptor (THRA or THRB) was found to result in the recruitment of a specific complex of Thyroid Receptor Associated Proteins - the TRAP coactivator complex - of which the TRAP220 subunit was later identified to be the Mediator 1 (MED1) homologue.<p>Similarly, binding of Vitamin D to the human Vitamin D3 Receptor was found to result in the recruitment of a specific complex of D Receptor Interacting Proteins - the DRIP coactivator complex, of which the DRIP205 subunit was later identified to be human MED1.''',

    202652: '''In addition to serving as a scaffold via auto-phosphorylation, ZAP-70 also phosphorylates a restricted set of substrates following TCR stimulation - including LAT and SLP-76. These substrates have been recognized to play pivotal role in TCR signaling by releasing second messengers. When phosphorylated, LAT and SLP-76 act as adaptor proteins which serve as nucleation points for the construction of a higher order signalosome: GADS, PLC-gamma1 and GRB2 bind to the LAT on the phosphorylated tyrosine residues (steps 8 and 13). SLP-76 and SOS are then moved to the signalosome by interacting with the SH3 domains of GRB2 and GADS via their proline rich sequences (step 9). Three SLP-76 acidic domain N-term tyrosine residues are phosphorylated by ZAP-70, once SLP-76 binds to GADS (step 10).

Three transcription factors in particular have been found to play a key role in TCR-stimulated changes in gene expression, namely NF-kB, NFAT and AP-1. <p>A key step in NF-kB activation is the stimulation and translocation of PKC theta. The critical element that effects PKC theta activation is PI3K. This enzyme complex translocates to the plasma membrane by interacting with phospho-tyrosines on CD28 via its two SH2 domains located in p85 subunit. The p110 subunit of PI3K phosphorylates the inositol ring of PIP2 to generate PIP3 (steps 17-18). PIP3 may also be dephosphorylated by the phosphatase SHIP to generate PI-3,4-P2.<p>PIP3 and PI-3,4-P2 acts as binding sites to the PH domain of PKB/Akt and PDK1 (steps 19, 21 and 22). PKB is activated in response to PI3K stimulation by PDK1 (step 23). PDK1 has an essential role in regulating the activation of PKC theta and recruitment of CBM complex to the immune synapse. PKC theta is a member of novel class (DAG dependent, Ca++ independent) of PKC and the only member known to translocate to this synapse. Prior to TCR stimulation PKC theta exists in an inactive closed conformation. Upon release of DAG, it binds to PKC theta via the C1 domain and undergoes phosphorylation on tyrosine 90 by Lck to attain an open conformation. PKC theta is further phosphorylated by PDK1 on threonine 538. This step is critical for PKC activity (steps 24-26). <p>CARMA1 translocates to the plasma membrane following the interaction of its SH3 domain with the 'PxxP' motif on PDK1. CARMA1 is phosphorylated by PKC-theta on residue S552, leading to the oligomerization of CARMA1. This complex acts as a scaffold, recruiting Bcl10 to the synapse by interacting with their CARD domains. <p>Bcl10 undergoes phosphorylation mediated by the enzyme RIP2. Activated Bcl10 then mediates the ubiquitination of NEMO by recruiting MALT1 and TRAF6. MALT1 binds to Bcl10 with its Ig-like domains and undergoes oligomerization.

TAK1 undergoes autophosphorylation on residues T184 and T187 and gets activated. Activated TAK1 kinase phosphorylates IKK-beta on residues S177 and S181 in the activation loop and activates the IKK kinase activity.

Heterodimers of ERBB2 and EGFR trans-autophosphorylate on twelve tyrosine residues, six in the C-tail of EGFR and six in the C-tail of ERBB2 - Y1023, Y1139, Y1196, Y1221, Y1222 and Y1248 (Margolis et al. 1989, Hazan et al. 1990,Walton et  al. 1990, Helin et al. 1991, Ricci et al. 1995, Pinkas-Kramarski 1996). Phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the C-tail of EGFR and ERBB2 serve as docking sites for downstream signaling molecules. Three key signaling pathways activated by ERBB2:EGFR heterodimers are RAF/MAP kinase cascade, PI3K-induced AKT signaling, and signaling by phospholipase C gamma (PLCG1). Downregulation of EGFR signaling is mediated by ubiquitin ligase CBL, and is shown under Signaling by EGFR.<br><br>
In cells expressing ERBB2 and ERBB3, ERBB3 activated by neuregulin NRG1 or NRG2 binding (Tzahar et al. 1994) forms a heterodimer with ERBB2 (Pinkas-Kramarski et al. 1996, Citri et al. 2004). ERBB3 is the only EGFR family member with no kinase activity, and can only function in heterodimers, with ERBB2 being its preferred heterodimerization partner. After heterodimerization, ERBB2 phosphorylates ten tyrosine residues in the C-tail of ERBB3, Y1054, Y1197, Y1199, Y1222, Y1224, Y1260, Y1262, Y1276, Y1289 and Y1328 (Prigent et al. 1994, Pinkas-Kramarski et al. 1996, Vijapurkar et al. 2003, Li et al. 2007) that subsequently serve as docking sites for downstream signaling molecules, resulting in activation of PI3K-induced AKT signaling and RAF/MAP kinase cascade. Signaling by ERBB3 is downregulated by the action of RNF41 ubiquitin ligase, also known as NRDP1. <br><br>
In cells expressing ERBB2 and ERBB4, ligand stimulated ERBB4 can either homodimerize or form heterodimers with ERBB2 (Li et al. 2007), resulting in trans-autophosphorylation of ERBB2 and ERBB4 on C-tail tyrosine residues that will subsequently serve as docking sites for downstream signaling molecules, leading to activation of RAF/MAP kinase cascade and, in the case of ERBB4 CYT1 isoforms, PI3K-induced AKT signaling (Hazan et al. 1990, Cohen et al. 1996, Li et al. 2007, Kaushansky et al. 2008).

They act through dephosphorylation of threonine and/or tyrosine residues within the signature sequence -pTXpY- located in the activation loop of MAP kinases (pT=phosphothreonine and pY=phosphotyrosine). MKPs are divided into three major categories depending on their preference for dephosphorylating; tyrosine, serine/threonine and both the tyrosine and threonine (dual specificity phoshatases or DUSPs). The tyrosine-specific MKPs include PTP-SL, STEP  and HePTP, serine/threonine-specific MKPs are PP2A and PP2C, and many DUSPs acting on MAPKs are known. Activated MAP kinases trigger activation of transcription of MKP genes.

The second cleavage occurs in the intramembrane region and is mediated by gamma-secretase and causes release of the intracellular domain, ICD, and of a small peptide. The ICD often traffics to the nucleus and, in some instances (e.g. NOTCH), was found to act as  transcriptional regulator. Whether the p75NTR ICD does translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression in a way similar to the NOTCH receptor remains to be seen.

RNF41 is subject to self-ubiquitination which keeps its levels low when ERBB3 is not stimulated, and preserves ERBB3 expression on the cell surface (Qiu et al. 2002).  Self-ubiquitination of RNF41 is reversible, through the action of ubiquitin protease USP8, an enzyme stabilized by AKT-mediated phosphorylation.  Therefore, activation of AKT by ERBB2:ERBB3 signaling leads to phosphorylation of USP8 (Cao et al. 2007), which increases level of RNF41 through deubiquitination, and results in degradation of activated ERBB3 (Cao et al. 2007) - a negative feedback loop of ERBB3 signaling.

    71614: '''The reactions of gluconeogenesis convert mitochondrial pyruvate to cytosolic glucose 6-phosphate which in turn can be hydrolyzed to glucose and exported from the cell. Gluconeogenesis is confined to cells of the liver and kidney and enables glucose synthesis from molecules such as lactate and alanine and other amino acids when exogenous glucose is not available (reviewed, e.g., by Gerich 1993). The process of gluconeogenesis as diagrammed below occurs in two parts: a network of reactions converts mitochondrial pyruvate to cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate; then phosphoenolpyruvate is converted to glucose 6-phosphate in a single sequence of cytosolic reactions.<p>Three variants of the first part of the process are physiologically important. 1) A series of transport and transamination reactions convert mitochondrial oxaloacetate to cytosolic oxaloacetate which is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate by a hormonally regulated, cytosolic isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. This variant allows regulated glucose synthesis from lactate. 2) Mitochondrial oxaloacetate is reduced to malate, which is exported to the cytosol and re-oxidized to oxaloacetate. This variant provides reducing equivalents to the cytosol, needed for glucose synthesis from amino acids such as alanine and glutamine. 3) Constitutively expressed mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase catalyzes the conversion of mitochondrial oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate which is then transported to the cytosol. The exact path followed by any one molecule of pyruvate through this reaction network is determined by the tissue in which the reactions are occurring, the source of the pyruvate, and the physiological stress that triggered gluconeogenesis.<p>In all cases, the synthesis of glucose from two molecules of pyruvate requires the generation and consumption of two reducing equivalents as cytosolic NADH + H+. For pyruvate derived from lactate (variants 1 and 3), NADH + H+ is generated with the oxidation of lactate to pyruvate in the cytosol (a reaction of pyruvate metabolism not shown in the diagram). For pyruvate derived from amino acids (variant 2), mitochondrial NADH + H+ generated by glutamate dehydrogenase (a reaction of amino acid metabolism, not shown) is used to reduce oxaloacetate to malate, which is transported to the cytosol and re-oxidized, generating cytosolic NADH + H+. The synthesis of glucose from pyruvate also requires the consumption of six high-energy phosphates, four from ATP and two from GTP.<p>In the second part of gluconeogenesis, cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate, however derived, is converted to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate by reactions that are the reverse of steps of glycolysis. Hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate is catalyzed by fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, and fructose 6-phosphate is reversibly isomerized to glucose 6-phosphate.''',

In six reversible reactions, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is converted to two molecules of phosphoenolpyruvate and two molecules of NAD+ are reduced to NADH + H+. Each molecule of phosphoenolpyruvate reacts with ADP to form ATP and pyruvate in a physiologically irreversible reaction. Under aerobic conditions the NADH +H+ can be reoxidized to NAD+ via electron transport to yield additional ATP, while under anaerobic conditions or in cells lacking mitochondria NAD+ can be regenerated via the reduction of pyruvate to lactate.''',

Melanocytes are distributed in the epidermis, hair follicles, the inner ear and the eye (Yamaguchi et al. 2007, Tolleson 2005). <br><br>Melanocytes in mammals and birds produce two chemically distinct types of melanin, black to brown eumelanin and yellow to reddish-brown pheomelanin (Ito & Wakamatsu 2008, Simon et al. 2009, d'Ischia et al. 2013). These differ in their responses to UV radiation; eumelanin has the ability to convert absorbed light energy into heat energy (Meredith & Riesz 2004) and to detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Bustamante et al. 1993), while pheomelanin is a phototoxic pro-oxidant (Samokhvalov 2005). Most natural melanin pigments contain eumelanin and pheomelanin (Ito & Wakamatsu 2003) and are termed 'mixed' melanins. Neuromelanins are mixed melanin-like pigments which are mainly found in neurons of the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus (Fedorow et al. 2005).

Models suggest that mixed melanogenesis occurs in three stages (Ito et al. 2000). The initial stage of melanin biosynthesis is the production of cysteinyldopas, which continues while sufficient cysteine is available. The second stage is the oxidation of cysteinyldopas to produce pheomelanin, which continues while cysteinyldopa concentration is sufficiently high. The last stage is the production of eumelanin, which begins when cysteinyldopas and cysteine are depleted. The ratio of eumelanin to pheomelanin is determined by tyrosinase activity and the availability of tyrosine and cysteine (Land et al. 2003).''',

When the buffering capacity of plasma haptoglobin is overwhelmed, heme is released from methemoglobin and it is bound by albumin and then transferred to hemopexin (reviewed in Chiabrando et al. 2011, Nielsen et al. 2010, Tolosano et al. 2010, Ascenzi et al. 2005, Tolosano and Altruda 2002). Hemopexin is produced mainly in the liver. Once secreted into the plasma, hemopexin binds heme and the hemopexin:heme complex is then preferentially delivered to liver hepatocytes, bound by LRP1 (CD91) and endocytosed. ''',

TBK1 was found to form complexes with distinct scaffolding proteins that appeared to target TBK1 to different subcellular compartments [Hemmi H et al 2004; Oganesyan G et al 2006; Chariot A et al 2002; Huang J et al 2005]. STING interacted with both TBK1 and IRF3. Once STING is stimulated, its C-terminus served as a signaling scaffold to recruit IRF3 anhd TBK1, which led to TBK1-dependent phosphorylation of IRF3. Phosphorylation of IRF3 promoted its dimerization and translocation to the nucleus, where it triggered the transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) (Tanaka Y and Chen ZJ 2012).''',

Nef also strongly down-modulates surface expression of the beta-chain of the CD8alphabeta receptor by accelerated endocytosis, while CD8 alpha-chain expression is less affected. Mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic tail of the CD8 beta-chain indicates that an FMK amino acid motif is critical for the Nef-induced endocytosis. Although independent of CD4, endocytosis of the CD8 beta-chain is abrogated by the same mutations in Nef that affect CD4 down-regulation, suggesting common molecular interactions. The ability to down-regulate the human CD8 beta-chain was conserved in HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac239 Nef and required an intact AP-2 complex.''',

These tails vary in sequence between tubulin isoforms and are exposed on the surfaces of microtubules. They can undergo a variety of posttranslational modifications, including the attachment and removal of polyglutamate chains and in the case of alpha-tunulins the loss and reattachment of a terminal tyrosine (Tyr) residue. These modifications are associated with changes in the rigidity and stability of microtubules (Song & Brady 2015; Yu et al. 2015).<br>Mutations affecting these modification processes can have severe effects on phenotype (e.g., Ikegami et al. 2007).

    83937: '''Two families of transport proteins mediate the movement of nucleosides and free purine and pyrimidine bases across the plasma membrane.  Equilibrative nucleoside transporters allow the movement of these molecules along concentration gradients into or out of cells (Baldwin et al. 2003); concentrative nucleoside transporters actively transport nucleosides into cells by coupling their transport to the inward movement of sodium ions (Gray et al. 2003).<P>Of the four human equilibrative nucleoside transporters, two are well characterized.  SLC29A1 (solute carrier family 29 (nucleoside transporters), member 1) mediates the transport of nucleosides across the plasma membrane.  SLC29A2 (solute carrier family 29 (nucleoside transporters), member 2) mediates the transport of both nucleosides and free bases.  Transporter specificities were determined by expressing cloned human genes in Xenopus oocytes or in mammalian cultured cell lines whose own nucleotide transporters had been disrupted by mutation.  These studies establish that the transport processes are specific and saturable, and that the multiple nucleotides and bases compete for a single binding site on each transporter.  Some features of  SLC29A2 specificity are complex.  For example, in the Xenopus oocyte system, radiolabeled uracil and adenine are taken up, and an excess of either molecule inhibits uptake of radiolabeled hypoxanthine, while in the cultured mammalian cell system, neither adenine nor uracil can inhibit uptake of radiolabeled uridine.  If these results reflect ENT2 function in vivo, they indicate that the net movement of a nucleoside or base across the cell membrane is determined not only by its own concentrations in the extracellular space and the cytosol, but also by the concentrations of the other nucleosides and bases competing for access to the transporter.<P>The human genome encodes three concentrative transporters, SLC28A1, 2, and 3 (solute carrier family 28 (sodium-coupled nucleoside transporter), member 1, 2, and 3).  All three genes have been cloned, and expression of the human proteins in Xenopus oocytes has allowed their transport properties to be determined.  SLC28A1 mediates the uptake of pyrimidine nucleosides and adenosine (Ritzel et al. 1997); SLC28A2 the uptake of purine nucleosides and uridine (Wang et al. 1997); and SLC28A3 the uptake of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides (Ritzel et al. 2001).  Amino acid sequence motifs that determine the specificities of these transporters have been identified in studies of chimeric and mutant proteins (Loewen et al. 1999).  SLC28A3 protein co-transports two sodium ions per nucleoside; SLC28A1 and 2 transport one sodium per nucleoside (Ritzel et al. 2001).<P>Physiological roles for nucleoside and base transport include provision of nucleosides to cells with little capacity to synthesize these molecules de novo, and regulation of extracellular levels of adenosine, which is released from muscle during intense exercise and has signaling properties.  In kidney and intestinal epithelia, the combination of apically localized CNT transporters and basolaterally localized ENT transporters provides a mechanism for net transport of nucleosides (Mangravite et al. 2003).  These transporters also mediate the uptake of nucleoside analogs used clinically as anti-viral and anti-tumor drugs.<P>Orthologs of human concentrative and equilibrative transporter proteins have been identified in many eukaryotes, but functional studies of transporters even from organisms closely related to humans (e.g. rat, Gerstin et al. 2002) have revealed differences in substrate specificities.  Prediction of drug uptake and other functions of these molecules by human - model organism orthology is thus risky.''',

Thus, Btn is necessary for cell growth, fatty acid synthesis and the metabolism of fats and amino acids. Inherited metabolic disorders characterized by deficient activities of all five biotin dependent carboxylases are termed multiple carboxylase deficiencies. Two congenital defects in biotin metabolism leading to multiple carboxylase deficiency are known, holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency (MIM 609018) and biotinidase deficiency (MIM 253260). In both scenarios symptoms include ketolactic acidosis, organic aciduria, hyperammonemia, skin rashes, hypotonia, seizures, developmental delay, alopecia, and coma. As humans are auxotrophic for Btn, the micronutrient must be obtained from external soures such as intestinal microflora and dietary forms. Accordingly, severe malnutrition can also give rise to biotin deficiency and multiple carboxylase deficiency. Biotin deficiency can also be induced by the excessive consumption of raw egg white that contains the biotin-binding protein avidin. Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency arises when all five biotin-dependent enzymes are not biotinylated leading to their reduced activities.

    198667: '''The location of neurotrophin stimulation appears to determine the nature of the transcriptional response through differential uses of individual MAP kinases. The ERK5 pathway has a unique function in retrograde signalling; in contrast, ERK1/2, which mediate nuclear responses following direct cell body stimulation, does not transmit a retrograde signal.  Following neurotrophin stimulation of distal axons, phosphorylated TRK receptors are endocytosed and transported to the cell bodies, where MEK5 phosphorylates ERK5, leading to ERK5 nuclear translocation,   phosphorylation of transcription factors, and neuronal survival. In contrast, neurotrophin stimulation of the cell bodies causes concurrent activation and nuclear transport of ERK1/2 as well as ERK5. Several distinctive features of the ERK5 pathway might be important for retrograde signalling. The ERK5 cascade does not depend on activation of the G-protein RAS. Instead, this pathway may use other G-proteins such as RAP that are associated with vesicles, or may not require any G-protein intermediate. Another distinctive feature is that the MEK5 isoform, which is expressed in the nervous system, exhibits a punctate staining pattern, suggesting a vesicular localization. ERK5 itself significantly differs from ERK1/2, and its substrate specificity also differs from ERK1/2. For instance, ERK5 directly activates transcription factors, including MEF2, that are not phosphorylated by ERK1/2. Conversely, ERK1/2, but not ERK5, activate transcription factors such as ELK1 and MITF.''',

Calcitonin is a 32 amino acid peptide, involved in bone homeostasis (Sexton PM et al, 1999). Amylin is a product of the islet beta-cell (Cooper GJ et al, 1987), along with insulin and probably has a hormonal role in the regulation of nutrient intake (Young A and Denaro M, 1998). Adrenomedullin (AM) is a ubiquitously expressed peptide initially isolated from phaechromocytoma (a tumour of the adrenal medulla) (Kitamura K et al, 1993). Both AM and AM2 (Takei Y et al, 2004) belong to a family of calcitonin-related peptide hormones important for regulating diverse physiologic functions and the chemical composition of fluids and tissues.<br>The receptor family for these peptides consists of two class B GPCRs, the calcitonin receptor (CT) and calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CL) (Poyner DR er al, 2002). Whilst the receptor for calcitonin is a conventional class B GPCR, the receptors for CGRP, AM and amylin require additional proteins, called the receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMPs). There are three RAMPs in mammals; they interact with the CT receptor to convert it to receptors for amylin. For CGRP and AM, the related CL interacts with RAMP1 to give a CGRP receptor and RAMP2 or 3 to give AM receptors. CL by itself will bind no known endogenous ligand.''',

Nef affects the cell surface expression of several cellular proteins.

DNA replication is carried out during a discrete temporal period known as the S (synthesis)-phase, and chromosome segregation occurs during a massive reorganization to cellular architecture at mitosis. Two gap-phases separate these major cell cycle events: G1 between mitosis and S-phase, and G2 between S-phase and mitosis. In the development of the human body, cells can exit the cell cycle for a period and enter a quiescent state known as G0, or terminally differentiate into cells that will not divide again, but undergo morphological development to carry out the wide variety of specialized functions of individual tissues.<p>A family of protein serine/threonine kinases known as the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) controls progression through the cell cycle.

The oscillation of cyclin abundance is one important mechanism by which these enzymes phosphorylate key substrates to promote events at the relevant time and place. Additional post-translational modifications and interactions with regulatory proteins ensure that CDK activity is precisely regulated, frequently confined to a narrow window of activity.<p>In addition, genome integrity in the cell cycle is maintained by the action of a number of signal transduction pathways, known as <b>cell cycle checkpoints</b>, which monitor the accuracy and completeness of DNA replication during S phase and the orderly chromosomal condensation, pairing and partition into daughter cells during mitosis.<p>Replication of telomeric DNA at the ends of human chromosomes and packaging of their centromeres into chromatin are two aspects of <b>chromosome maintenance</b> that are integral parts of the cell cycle.<p><b>Meiosis</b> is the specialized form of cell division that generates haploid gametes from diploid germ cells, associated with recombination (exchange of genetic material between chromosomal homologs).''',
    976920: '''Amyloid is a term used to describe deposits of fibrillar proteins, typically extracellular. The abnormal accumulation of amyloid, amyloidosis, is a term associated with tissue damage caused by amyloid deposition, seen in numerous diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's. Amyloid deposits consist predominantly of amyloid fibrils, rigid, non-branching structures that form ordered assemblies, characteristically with a cross beta-sheet structure where the sheets run parallel to the direction of the fibril (Sawaya et al. 2007). Often the fibril has a left-handed twist (Nelson & Eisenberg 2006). At least 27 human proteins form amyloid fibrils (Sipe et al. 2010). Many of these proteins have non-pathological functions; the trigger that leads to abnormal aggregations differs between proteins and is not well understood but in many cases the peptides are abnormal fragments or mutant forms arising from polymorphisms, suggesting that the initial event may be aggregation of misfolded or unfolded peptides. Early studies of Amyloid-beta assembly led to a widely accepted model that assembly was a nucleation-dependent polymerization reaction (Teplow 1998) but it is now understood to be more complex, with multiple 'off-pathway' events leading to a variety of oligomeric structures in addition to fibrils (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008), though it is unclear whether these intermediate steps are required in vivo. An increasing body of evidence suggests that these oligomeric forms are primarily responsible for the neurotoxic effects of Amyloid-beta (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008), alpha-synuclein (Winner et al. 2011) and tau (Dance & Strobel 2009, Meraz-Rios et al. 2010). Amyloid oligomers are believed to have a common structural motif that is independent of the protein involved and not present in fibrils (Kayed et al. 2003). Conformation dependent, aggregation specific antibodies suggest that there are 3 general classes of amyloid oligomer structures (Glabe 2009) including annular structures which may be responsible for the widely reported membrane permeabilization effect of amyloid oligomers. Toxicity of amyloid oligomers preceeds the appearance of plaques in mouse models (Ferretti et al. 2011). <br>Fibrils are often associated with other molecules, notably heparan sulfate proteoglycans and Serum Amyloid P-component, which are universally associated and seem to stabilize fibrils, possibly by protecting them from degradation.''',

    8865867: '''Ubiquitin is a small, 76 amino acid residue protein that is conjugated by E3 ubiquitin ligases to other proteins in order to regulate their function or degradation (enzymatic cascade reviewed in Neutzner and Neutzner 2012, Kleiger and Mayor 2014, structures and mechanisms of conjugating enzymes reviewed in Lorenz et al. 2013). Ubiquitination of target proteins usually occurs between the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin and a lysine residue of the target, although linkages with cysteine, serine, and threonine residues are also observed (reviewed in Wang et al. 2012, McDowell and Philpott 2013).<br>Ubiquitin must first be processed from larger precursors and then activated by formation of a thiol ester bond between ubiquitin and an E1 activating enzyme (UBA1 or UBA6) and transfer to an E2 conjugating enzyme before being transferred by an E3 ligase to a target protein. Precursor proteins containing multiple ubiquitin monomers (polyubiquitins) are produced from the UBB and UBC genes; precursors containing a single ubiquitin monomer and a ribosomal protein are produced from the UBA52 and RPS27A genes. Many proteases (deubiquitinases) may potentially process these precursors yielding monomeric ubiquitin. The proteases OTULIN and USP5 are particularly active in cleaving the polyubiquitin precursors, whereas the proteases UCHL3, USP7, and USP9X cleave the ubiquitin-ribosomal protein precursors yielding ubiquitin monomers (Grou et al. 2015). A resultant ubiquitin monomer is activated by adenylation of the C-terminal glycine followed by conjugation of the C-terminus to a cysteine residue of the E1 enzymes UBA1 or UBA6 via a thiol ester bond. The ubiquitin is then transferred from the E1 enzyme to a cysteine residue of one of several E2 enzymes (reviewed in van Wijk and Timmers 2010, Stewart et al. 2016). Through a less well characterized mechanism, E3 ubiquitin ligases then bring a target protein and the E2-ubiquitin conjugate into proximity so that the ubiquitin is transferred via formation of an amide bond to a particular lysine residue (or, in rarer cases, a thiol ester bond to a cysteine residue or an ester bond to a serine or threonine residue) of the target protein (reviewed in Berndsen and Wolberger 2014). Based on protein homologies, families of E3 ubiquitin ligases have been identified that include RING-type ligases (reviewed in Deshaies et al. 2009, Metzger et al. 2012, Metzger et al. 2014), HECT-type ligases (reviewed in Rotin et al. 2009, Metzger et al. 2012), and RBR-type ligases (reviewed in Dove et al. 2016). A subset of the RING-type ligases participate in CULLIN-RING ligase complexes (CRLs which include SCF complexes, reviewed in Lee and Zhou 2007, Genschik et al. 2013, Skaar et al. 2013, Lee et al. 2014).<br>Some E3-E2 combinations catalyze mono-ubiquitination of the target protein (reviewed in Nakagawa and Nakayama 2015). Other E3-E2 combinations catalyze conjugation of further ubiquitin monomers to the initial ubiquitin, forming polyubiquitin chains. (It may also be possible for some E3-E2 combinations to preassemble polyubiquitin and transfer it as a unit to the target protein.) Ubiquitin contains several lysine (K) residues and a free alpha amino group  to which further ubiquitin can be conjugated. Thus different types of polyubiquitin are possible: K11 linked polyubiquitin is observed in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), K29 linked polyubiquitin is observed in lysosomal degradation, K48 linked polyubiquitin directs target proteins to the proteasome for degradation, whereas K63 linked polyubiquitin generally acts as a scaffold to recruit other proteins in several cellular processes, notably DNA repair (reviewed in Komander et al. 2009). Ubiquitination is highly regulated (reviewed in Vittal et al. 2015) and affects all cellular processes including DNA damage response (reviewed in Brown and Jackson 2015), immune signaling (reviewed in Park et al. 2014, Lutz-Nicoladoni et al. 2015), and regulation of normal and cancerous cell growth (reviewed in Skaar and Pagano 2009, Yerlikaya and Yontem 2013, Strikoudis et al. 2014).''',

    927821: '''The Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) pathway activates the destruction of mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs) (reviewed in Isken and Maquat 2007, Chang et al. 2007, Behm-Ansmant et al. 2007, Neu-Yilik and Kulozik 2008, Rebbapragada and Lykke-Andersen 2009, Bhuvanagiri et al. 2010, Nicholson et al. 2010, Durand and Lykke-Andersen 2011). In mammalian cells a termination codon can be recognized as premature if it precedes an exon-exon junction by at least 50-55 nucleotides or if it is followed by an abnormal 3' untranslated region (UTR). While length of the UTR may play a part, the qualifications for being "abnormal" have not been fully elucidated. Also, some termination codons preceding exon junctions are not degraded by NMD so the criteria for triggering NMD are not yet fully known (reviewed in Rebbapragada and Lykke-Andersen 2009). While about 30% of disease-associated mutations in humans activate NMD, about 10% of normal human transcripts are also degraded by NMD (reviewed in Stalder and Muhlemann 2008, Neu-Yilik and Kulozik 2008, Bhuvanagiri et al. 2010,  Nicholson et al. 2010). Thus NMD is a normal physiological process controlling mRNA stability in unmutated cells.<br>Exon junction complexes (EJCs) are deposited on an mRNA during splicing in the nucleus and are displaced by ribosomes during the first round of translation.

Normally, eRF1 cleaves the translated polypeptide from the tRNA in the P site and eRF3 interacts with Polyadenylate-binding protein (PABP) bound to the polyadenylated tail of the mRNA.<br>During activation of NMD eRF3 interacts with UPF1 which is contained in a complex with SMG1, SMG8, and SMG9. NMD can arbitrarily be divided into EJC-enhanced and EJC-independent pathways. In EJC-enhanced NMD, an exon junction is located downstream of the PTC and the EJC remains on the mRNA after termination of the pioneer round of translation. The core EJC is associated with UPF2 and UPF3, which interact with UPF1 and stimulate NMD. Once bound near the PTC, UPF1 is phosphorylated by SMG1. The phosphorylation is the rate-limiting step in NMD and causes UPF1 to recruit either SMG6, which is an endoribonuclease, or SMG5 and SMG7, which recruit ribonucleases. SMG6 and SMG5:SMG7 recruit phosphatase PP2A to dephosphorylate UPF1 and allow further rounds of degradation. How EJC-independent NMD is activated remains enigmatic but may involve competition between PABP and UPF1 for eRF3.''',

To stimulate RET, these ligands need a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored co-receptor, collectively termed GDNF family receptor-alpha (GFRA) (Treanor et al. 1996, Jing et al. 1996). The four members of this family have different, overlapping ligand preferences. GFRA1, GFRA2, GFRA3, and GFRA4 preferentially bind GDNF, NRTN, ARTN and PSPN, respectively (Jing et al. 1996, 1997, Creedon et al. 1997, Baloh et al. 1997, 1998, Masure et al. 2000). The GFRA co-receptor can come from the same cell as RET, or from a different cell. When the co-receptor is produced by the same cell as RET, it is termed cis signaling. When the co-receptor is produced by another cell, it is termed trans signaling. Cis and trans activation has been proposed to diversify RET signaling, either by recruiting different downstream effectors or by changing the kinetics or efficacy of kinase activation (Tansey et al. 2000, Paratcha et al. 2001). Whether cis and trans signaling has significant differences in vivo is unresolved (Fleming et al. 2015). Different GDNF family members could activate similar downstream signaling pathways since all GFRAs bind to and activate the same tyrosine kinase and induce coordinated phosphorylation of the same four RET tyrosines (Tyr905, Tyr1015, Tyr1062, and Tyr1096) with similar kinetics (Coulpier et al. 2002).

    141417: '''The mitotic checkpoint or spindle assembly checkpoint is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that ensures that cells with misaligned chromosomes do not exit mitosis and divide to form aneuploid cells. As chromosome attachment to the spindle microtubules is a stochastic process, not all chromosomes achieve alignment at the spindle equator at the same time. It is therefore essential that even a single unaligned chromosome can prevent the onset of anaphase. The ability of the checkpoint to monitor the status of chromosome alignment is achieved by assigning checkpoint proteins to the kinetochore, a macromolecular complex that resides at centromeres of chromosomes that establishes connections with spindle microtubules. <P>The checkpoint proteins monitor, in an unknown way, the mechanical activities between kinetochore-associated proteins and microtubules.  Defects in mechanical activities at kinetochores activate the resident checkpoint proteins to initiate a signal that is amplified throughout the cell that ultimately prevents the activation of the proteolytic process that is required for sister chromatid separation and the onset of anaphase.
Kinetochores of unaligned chromosomes differ from those of aligned chromosomes in two ways. Kinetochores of aligned chromosomes are saturated with between 20 to 30 microtubules. In addition, poleward directed forces exerted at each sister kinetochore generates tension between them. Unaligned kinetochores on the other hand, are not saturated with microtubules and are not under tension. The mitotic checkpoint detects the presence of unattached kinetochores rather than monitoring for the presence of attached kinetochores. Consequently, unattached kinetochores emit an inhibitory signal that inhibits the biochemical events that are required to initiate the onset of anaphase. The mechanism by which this inhibitory signal is generated at unattached kinetochores has not precisely been determined but the signal is generated as a result of the lack of microtubule occupancy and kinetochore tension.
A single unattached kinetochore is capable of preventing cells from exiting mitosis. The mitotic checkpoint provides a way for a localized defect to affect the global biochemical status of the cell. In principle, the signal that is generated at an unattached kinetochore diffuses throughout the cell to affect its target.  There are currently two models for how this is achieved.  One model is based on the observation that the Mad2 checkpoint protein binds and is rapidly released from unattached kinetochores. The kinetochore is believed to act as a catalyst that converts Mad2 into an inhibitory state that diffuses throughout the cell upon its release from the  kinetochore. A second model proposes that the signal is amplified by a kinase cascade much like a conventional signal transduction pathway. This kinase cascade is believed to be comprised of the checkpoint kinases, hBUBR1, hBUB1, hMPS1.''',

As MKs mature they undergo endoreduplication (polyploidisation) and expansion of cytoplasmic mass to cell sizes larger than 50-100 microns, and ploidy ranges up to 128 N. As MKs mature, the polyploid nucleus becomes horseshoe-shaped, the cytoplasm expands, and platelet organelles and the demarcation membrane system are amplified. Proplatelet projections form which give rise to de novo circulating platelets (Deutsch & Tomer 2006).  <br>The processes of megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production occur within a complex microenvironment where chemokines, cytokines and adhesive interactions play major roles (Avecilla et al. 2004). Megakaryocytopoiesis is regulated at several levels including proliferation, differentiation and platelet release (Kaushansky 2003). Thrombopoietin (TPO/c-Mpl ligand) is the most potent cytokine stimulating proliferation and maturation of MK progenitors (Kaushansky 2005) but many other growth factors are involved. MK development is controlled by the action of multiple transcription factors. Many MK-specific genes are co-regulated by GATA and friend of GATA (FOG), RUNX1 and ETS proteins.

It synthesizes an eclectic collection of catalytic or structural RNA molecules, some of which are involved in protein synthesis, pre-mRNA splicing, tRNA processing, and the control of RNA polymerase II elongation, whereas some others have still unknown functions.  Like other RNA polymerases, RNA polymerase III cannot recognize its target promoters directly.  Instead it is recruited to specific promoter sequences through the help of transcription factors.

    1022123: '''In the complement cascade, a panel of soluble molecules rapidly and effectively senses a danger or damage and triggers reactions to provide a response that discriminates among foreign intruders, cellular debris, healthy and altered host cells (Ricklin D et al. 2010). Complement proteins circulate in the blood stream in functionally inactive states. When triggered the complement cascade generates enzymatically active molecules (such as C3/C5 convertases) and biological effectors: opsonins (C3b, C3d and C4b), anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a), and C5b, which initiates assembly of the lytic membrane attack complex (MAC). Three branches lead to complement activation: the classical, lectin and alternative pathways (Kang YH et al. 2009; Ricklin D et al. 2010). The classical pathway is initiated by C1 complex binding to immune complexes, pentraxins or other targets such as apoptotic cells leading to cleavage of C4 and C2 components and formation of the classical C3 convertase, C4bC2a. The lectin pathway is activated by binding of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) to repetitive carbohydrate residues, or by binding of ficolins to carbohydrate or acetylated groups on target surfaces. MBL and ficolins interact with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP) leading to cleavage of C4 and C2 and formation of the classical C3 convertase, C4bC2a. The alternative pathway is spontaneously activated by the hydrolysis of the internal thioester group of C3 to give C3(H2O). Alternative pathway activation involves interaction of C3(H2O) and/or previously generated C3b with factor B, which is cleaved by factor D to generate the alternative C3 convertases C3(H2O)Bb and/or C3bBb. All three pathways merge at the proteolytic cleavage of component C3 by C3 convertases to form opsonin C3b and anaphylatoxin C3a. C3b covalently binds to glycoproteins scattered across the target cell surface. This is followed by an amplification reaction that generates additional C3 convertases and deposits more C3b at the local site. C3b can also bind to C3 convertases switching them to C5 convertases, which mediate C5 cleavage leading to MAC formation. Thus, the activation of the complement system leads to several important outcomes:<ul><li>opsonization of target cells to enhance phagocytosis,</li><li>lysis of target cells via membrane attack complex (MAC) assembly on the cell surface,</li><li>production of anaphylatoxins C3a/C5a involved in the host inflammatory response,</li><li>C5a-mediated leukocyte chemotaxis,</li><li>and clearance of antibody-antigen complexes.</li></ul><br>The complement system is able to distinguish between pathological and physiological challenges, i.e. the outcomes of complement activation are predetermined by the trigger and are tightly tuned by a combination of initiation events with several regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms use soluble (e.g., C4BP, CFI and CFH) and membrane-bound regulators (e.g., CR1, CD46(MCP), CD55(DAF) and CD59) and are coordinated by complement receptors such as CR1, CR2, etc.<p>In response to microbial infection complement activation results in flagging microorganisms with opsonins for facilitated phagocytosis, formation of MAC on cells such as Gram-negative bacteria leading to cell lysis, and release of C3a and C5a to stimulate downstream immune responses and to attract leukocytes. Most pathogens can be eliminated by these complement-mediated host responses, though some pathogenic microorganisms have developed ways of avoiding complement recognition or blocking host complement attack resulting in greater virulence (Lambris JD et al. 2008; Serruto D et al. 2010).<p>All three complement pathways (classical, lectin and alternative) have been implicated in clearance of dying cells (Mevorach D et al. 1998; Ogden CA et al. 2001; Gullstrand B et al.2009; Kemper C et al. 2008). Altered surfaces of apoptotic cells are recognized by complement proteins leading to opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis. In contrast to pathogens, apoptotic cells are believed to induce only a limited complement activation by allowing opsonization of altered surfaces but restricting the terminal pathway of MAC formation (Gershov D et al. 2000; Braunschweig A and Jozsi M 2011). Thus, opsonization facilitates clearance of dying cells and cell debris without triggering danger signals and further inflammatory responses (Fraser DA et al. 2007, 2009; Benoit ME et al. 2012). C1q-mediated complement activation by apoptotic cells has been shown in a variety of human cells: keratinocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), Jurkat T lymphoblastoid cells, lung adenocarcinoma cells (Korb LC and Ahearn JM 1997; Mold C and Morris CA 2001; Navratil JS et al. 2001; Nauta AJ et al. 2004). In addition to C1q the opsonization of apoptotic Jurkat T cells with MBL also facilitated clearance of these cells by both dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages (Nauta AJ et al. 2004). Also C3b, iC3b and C4b deposition on apoptotic cells as a consequence of activation of the complement cascade may promote complement-mediated phagocytosis. C1q, MBL and cleavage fragments of C3/C4 can bind to several receptors expressed on macrophages (e.g. cC1qR (calreticulin), CR1, CR3, CR4) suggesting a potential clearance mechanism through this interaction (Mevorach D et al. 1998; Ogden CA et al. 2001). Apoptosis is also associated with an altered expression of complement regulators on the surface of apoptotic cells. CD46 (MCP) bound to the plasma membrane of a healthy cell protects it from complement-mediated attack by preventing deposition of C3b and C4b, and reduced expression of CD46 on dying cells may lead to enhanced opsonization (Elward K et al. 2005). Upregulation of CD55 (DAF) and CD59 on apoptotic cell surfaces may protect damaged cells against complement mediated lysis (Pedersen ED et al. 2007; Iborra A et al. 2003; Hensel F et al. 2001). In addition, fluid-phase complement regulators such as C4BP, CFH may also inhibit lysis of apoptotic cells by limiting complement activation (Trouw LA et al 2007; Braunschweig A and Jozsi M. 2011).<p>Complement facilitates the clearance of immune complexes (IC) from the circulation (Chevalier J and Kazatchkine MD 1989; Nielsen CH et al. 1997). Erythrocytes bear clusters of complement receptor 1 (CR1 or CD35), which serves as an immune adherence receptor for C3 and/or C4 fragments deposited on IC that are shuttled to liver and spleen, where IC are transferred and processed by tissue macrophages through an Fc receptor-mediated process.<p>Complement proteins are always present in the blood and a small percentage spontaneously activate. Inappropriate activation leads to host cell damage, so on healthy human cells any complement activation or amplification is strictly regulated by surface-bound regulators that accelerate decay of the convertases (CR1, CD55), act as a cofactor for the factor I (CFI)-mediated degradation of C3b and C4b (CR1, CD46), or prevent the formation of MAC (CD59). Soluble regulators such as C4BP, CFH and FHL1 recognize self surface pattern-like glycosaminoglycans and further impair activation.<p>Complement components interact with other biological systems. Upon microbial infection complement acts in cooperation with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to amplify innate host defense. Anaphylatoxin C5a binds C5a receptor (C5aR) resulting in a synergistic enhancement of the TLR and C5aR-mediated proinflammatory cytokine response to infection. This interplay is negatively modulated by co-ligation of TLR and the second C5a receptor, C5L2, suggesting the existence of complex immunomodulatory interactions (Kohl J 2006; Hajishengallis G and Lambris JD 2010). In addition to C5aR and C5L2, complement receptor 3 (CR3) facilitates TLR2 or TLR4 signaling pathways by promoting a recruitment of their sorting adaptor TIRAP (MAL) to the receptor complex (van Bruggen R et al. 2007; Kagan JC and Medzhitov R 2006). Complement may activate platelets or facilitate biochemical and morphological changes in the endothelium potentiating coagulation and contributing to homeostasis in response to injury (Oikonomopoulou K et al. 2012). The interplay of complement and coagulation also involves cleavage of C3 and C5 convertases by coagulation proteases, generating biologically active anaphylatoxins (Amara U et al. 2010). Complement is believed to link the innate response to both humoral and cell-mediated immunity (Toapanta FR and Ross TM 2006; Mongini PK et al. 1997). The majority of published data is based on experiments using mouse as a model organism. Further characterization of the influence of complement on B or T cell activation is required for the human system, since differences between murine models and the human system are not yet fully determined. Complement is also involved in regulation of mobilization and homing of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from bone marrow to the circulation and peripheral tissue in order to accommodate blood cell replenishment (Reca R et al. 2006).<p>Thus, the complement system orchestrates the host defense by sensing a danger signal and transmitting it into specific cellular responses while extensively communicating with associated biological pathways ranging from immunity and inflammation to homeostasis and development.<br><br>N.B. Originally the larger fragment of Complement Factor 2 (C2) was designated C2a. However, complement scientists decided that the smaller of all C fragments should be designated with an 'a', the larger with a 'b', changing the nomenclature for C2. Recent literature may use the updated nomenclature and refer to the larger C2 fragment as C2b, and refer to the classical C3 convertase as C4bC2b. Throughout this pathway Reactome adheres to the original convention to agree with the current (Sep 2013) Uniprot names for C2 fragments.''',

While LAT is essential for signalling to PLCgamma1 downstream of the T-cell receptor, the absence of LAT in platelets only impairs the activation of PLCgamma2, the response to collagen and GPVI receptor ligands remains sufficient to elicit a full aggregation response.

    75956: '''The mechanisms governing the process of elongation during eukaryotic mRNA synthesis are being unraveled by recent studies. These studies have led to the expected discovery of a diverse collection of transcription factors that directly regulate the activities of RNA Polymerase II and unexpected discovery of roles for many elongation factors in other basic processes like DNA repair, recombination, etc. The transcription machinery and structural features of the major RNA polymerases are conserved across species. The genes active during elongation fall under different classes like, housekeeping, cell-cycle regulated, development and differentiation specific genes etc. The list of genes involved in elongation has been growing in recent times, and include: -TFIIS,DSIF, NELF, P-Tefb etc. that are involved in drug induced or sequence-dependent arrest - TFIIF, ELL, elongin, elongator etc. that are involved in increasing the catalytic rate of elongation by altering the Km and/or the Vmax of Pol II -FACT, Paf1 and other factors that are involved chromatin modification - DNA repair proteins, RNA processing and export factors, the 19S proteasome and a host of other factors like Spt5-Spt5, Paf1, and NELF complexes, FCP1P etc. (Arndt and Kane, 2003).  Elongation also represents processive phase of transcription in which the activities of several mRNA processing factors are coupled to transcription through their binding to RNA polymerase (Pol II). One of the key events that enables this interaction is the differential phosphorylation of Pol II CTD. Phosphorylation pattern of CTD changes during transcription, most significantly at the beginning and during elongation process. TFIIH-dependent Ser5 phosphorylation is observed primarily at promoter regions while P-Tefb mediated Ser2 phosphorylation is seen mainly in the coding regions, during elongation. Experimental evidence suggests a dynamic association of RNA processing factors with differently modified forms of the polymerase during the transcription cycle. (Komarnitsky et al., 2000).

    420028: '''Tight junctions (TJs) are the most apical component of the epithelial junctional complex forming a belt-like structure at the cellular junction. When visualized by freeze-fracture electron microscopy they appear as a branched network of intramembrane strands that correspond to the sites of direct membrane contacts and that are composed of the integral membrane claudin proteins. The TJs act as a primary barrier to the diffusion of solutes through the paracellular space (barrier function) (Tsukita et al., 2001). They also prevent the intermixing of intramembrane proteins and lipids and thus create a boundary between the apical and the basolateral membrane domains of polarized epithelial cells (fence function) (Tsukita et al., 2001). Interestingly, the fence function seems not to depend on TJ strands (Umeda et al., 2006).

    5675202: '''Activated RAF proteins are restricted substrate kinases whose primary downstream targets are the two MAP2K proteins, MAPK2K1 and MAP2K2 (also known as MEK1 and MEK2) (reviewed in Roskoski, 2010, Roskoski, 2012a).  Phosphorylation of the MAPK2K activation loop primes them to phosphorylate the primary effector of the activated MAPK pathway, the two MAPK proteins MAPK3 and MAPK1 (also known as ERK1 and 2).

TAK1 phosphorylates the IKK-beta subunit, activating it (Wang et al. 2001).

    5617858: '''In mammals, anterior Hox genes may be defined as paralog groups 1 to 4 (Natale et al. 2011), which are involved in development of the hindbrain through sequential expression in the rhombomeres, transient segments of the neural tube that form during development of the hindbrain (reviewed in Alexander et al. 2009, Soshnikova and Duboule 2009, Tumpel et al. 2009, Mallo et al. 2010, Andrey and Duboule 2014). Hox gene activation during mammalian development has been most thoroughly studied in mouse embryos and the results have been extended to human development by in vitro experiments with human embryonal carcinoma cells and human embryonic stem cells.<br>Expression of a typical anterior Hox gene has an anterior boundary located at the junction between two rhombomeres and continues caudally to regulate segmentation and segmental fate in ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Anterior boundaries of expression of successive Hox paralog groups are generally separated from each other by 2 rhombomeres. For example, HOXB2 is expressed in rhombomere 3 (r3) and caudally while HOXB3 is expressed in r5 and caudally. Exceptions exist, however, as HOXA1, HOXA2, and HOXB1 do not follow the rule and HOXD1 and HOXC4 are not expressed in rhombomeres. Hox genes within a Hox cluster are expressed colinearly: the gene at the 3' end of the cluster is expressed earliest, and hence most anteriorly, then genes 5' are activated sequentially in the same order as they occur in the cluster. <br>Activation of expression occurs epigenetically by loss of polycomb repressive complexes and change of bivalent chromatin to active chromatin through, in part, the actions of trithorax family proteins (reviewed in Soshnikova and Duboule 2009). Hox gene expression initiates in the posterior primitive streak that will contribute to extraembryonic mesoderm. Expression then extends anteriorly into the cells that will become the embryo, where expression is first observed in presumptive lateral plate mesoderm and is transmitted to both paraxial mesoderm and neurectoderm formed by gastrulation along the primitive streak (reviewed in Deschamps et al. 1999, Casaca et al. 2014).<br>Prior to establishment of the rhombomeres, expression of HOXA1 and HOXB1 is initiated near the future site of r3 and caudally by a gradient of retinoic acid (RA). (Mechanisms of retinoic acid signaling are reviewed in Cunningham and Duester 2015.) The RA is generated by the ALDH1A2 (RALDH2) enzyme located in somites flanking the caudal hindbrain and degraded by CYP26 enzymes expressed initially in anterior neural ectoderm of the early gastrula and then throughout most of the hindbrain (reviewed in White and Schilling 2008). HOXA1 with PBX1,2 and MEIS2 directly activate transcription of ALDH1A2 to maintain retinoic acid synthesis in the somitic mesoderm (Vitobello et al. 2011). Differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells and embryonic stem cells in response to retinoic acid is used to model the process of differentiation in vitro (reviewed in Soprano et al. 2007, Gudas et al. 2013).<br>HOXA1 appears to set the anterior limit of HOXB1 expression (Barrow et al. 2000). HOXB1 initiates expression of EGR2 (KROX20) in presumptive r3. EGR2 then activates HOXA2 expression in r3 and r5 while HOXB1, together with PBX1 and MEIS:PKNOX1 (MEIS:PREP), activates expression of HOXA2 in r4 and caudal rhombomeres.  AP-2 transcription factors maintain expression of HOXA2 in neural crest cells (Maconochie et al. 1999). HOXB1 also activates expression of HOXB2 in r3 and caudal rhombomeres. EGR2 negatively regulates HOXB1 so that by the time rhombomeres appear, HOXB1 is restricted to r4 and HOXA1 is no longer detectable (Barrow et al. 2000). EGR2 and MAFB (Kreisler) then activate HOXA3 and HOXB3 in r5 and caudal rhombomeres. Retinoic acid activates HOXA4, HOXB4, and HOXD4 in r7, the final rhombomere. HOX proteins, in turn, activate expression of genes in combination with other factors, notably members of the TALE family of transcription factors (PBX, PREP, and MEIS, reviewed in Schulte and Frank 2014, Rezsohazy et al. 2015). HOX proteins also participate in non-transcriptional interactions (reviewed in Rezsohazy 2014). In zebrafish, Xenopus, and chicken factors such as Meis3, Fgf3, Fgf8, and vHNF regulate anterior hox genes (reviewed in Schulte and Frank 2014), however less is known about the roles of homologous factors in mammals.<br> Mutations in HOXA1 in humans have been observed to cause developmental abnormalities located mostly in the head and neck region (Tischfield et al. 2005, Bosley et al. 2008). A missense mutation in HOXA2 causes microtia, hearing impairment, and partially cleft palate (Alasti et al. 2008). A missense mutation in HOXB1 causes a similar phenotype to the Hoxb1 null mutation in mice: bilateral facial palsy, hearing loss, and strabismus (improper alignment of the eyes) (Webb et al. 2012).''',
    5675209: '''The duration and extent of activated MAPK signaling is regulated at many levels through mechanisms that include phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, changes to protein interacting partners and subcellular localization (reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011).  <br><br>Activated RAF proteins are subject to MAPK-dependent phosphorylation that promotes the subsequent dephosphorylation of the activation loop and NtA region, terminating RAF kinase activity. This dephosphorylation, catalyzed by PP2A and PP5, primes the RAF proteins for PKA or AKT-mediated phosphorylation of residues S259 and S621, restoring the 14-3-3 binding sites and returning the RAF proteins to the inactive state (von Kriegsheim et al, 2006;  Dougherty et al, 2005; reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011). The phosphorylated RAF1 NtA is also subject to additional regulation through binding to the PEBP1 protein, which promotes its dissociation from MAP2K substrates (Shin et al, 2009). <br><br>Activated MAPK proteins also phosphorylate T292 of MAP2K1; this phosphorylation limits the activity of MAP2K1, and indirectly affects MAP2K2 activity through by modulating the activity of the MAP2K heterodimer (Catalanotti et al, 2009; reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011).<br><br>Dephosphorylation of MAPKs by the dual specificity MAPK phosphatases (DUSPs) plays a key role in limiting the extent of pathway activation (Owens et al, 2007; reviewed in Roskoski, 2012b).

    3877067: '''The culture medium of senescent cells in enriched in secreted proteins when compared with the culture medium of quiescent i.e. presenescent cells and these secreted proteins constitute the so-called senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), also known as the senescence messaging secretome (SMS). SASP components include inflammatory and immune-modulatory cytokines (e.g. IL6 and IL8), growth factors (e.g. IGFBPs), shed cell surface molecules (e.g. TNF receptors) and survival factors. While the SASP exhibits a wide ranging profile, it is not significantly affected by the type of senescence trigger (oncogenic signalling, oxidative stress or DNA damage) or the cell type (epithelial vs. mesenchymal) (Coppe et al. 2008). However, as both oxidative stress and oncogenic signaling induce DNA damage, the persistent DNA damage may be a deciding SASP initiator (Rodier et al. 2009). SASP components function in an autocrine manner, reinforcing the senescent phenotype (Kuilman et al. 2008, Acosta et al. 2008), and in the paracrine manner, where they may promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignancy in the nearby premalignant or malignant cells (Coppe et al. 2008). Interleukin-1-alpha (IL1A), a minor SASP component whose transcription is stimulated by the AP-1 (FOS:JUN) complex (Bailly et al. 1996), can cause paracrine senescence through IL1 and inflammasome signaling (Acosta et al. 2013).<p>Here, transcriptional regulatory processes that mediate the SASP are annotated. DNA damage triggers ATM-mediated activation of TP53, resulting in the increased level of CDKN1A (p21). CDKN1A-mediated inhibition of CDK2 prevents phosphorylation and inactivation of the Cdh1:APC/C complex, allowing it to ubiquitinate and target for degradation EHMT1 and EHMT2 histone methyltransferases. As EHMT1 and EHMT2 methylate and silence the promoters of IL6 and IL8 genes, degradation of these methyltransferases relieves the inhibition of IL6 and IL8 transcription (Takahashi et al. 2012). In addition, oncogenic RAS signaling activates the CEBPB (C/EBP-beta) transcription factor (Nakajima et al. 1993, Lee et al. 2010), which binds promoters of IL6 and IL8 genes and stimulates their transcription (Kuilman et al. 2008, Lee et al. 2010). CEBPB also stimulates the transcription of CDKN2B (p15-INK4B), reinforcing the cell cycle arrest (Kuilman et al. 2008). CEBPB transcription factor has three isoforms, due to three alternative translation start sites. The CEBPB-1 isoform (C/EBP-beta-1) seems to be exclusively involved in growth arrest and senescence, while the CEBPB-2 (C/EBP-beta-2) isoform may promote cellular proliferation (Atwood and Sealy 2010 and 2011). IL6 signaling stimulates the transcription of CEBPB (Niehof et al. 2001), creating a positive feedback loop (Kuilman et al. 2009, Lee et al. 2010). NF-kappa-B transcription factor is also activated in senescence (Chien et al. 2011) through IL1 signaling (Jimi et al. 1996, Hartupee et al. 2008, Orjalo et al. 2009). NF-kappa-B binds IL6 and IL8 promoters and cooperates with CEBPB transcription factor in the induction of IL6 and IL8 transcription (Matsusaka et al. 1993, Acosta et al. 2008). Besides IL6 and IL8, their receptors are also upregulated in senescence (Kuilman et al. 2008, Acosta et al. 2008) and IL6 and IL8 may be master regulators of the SASP.<p>IGFBP7 is also an SASP component that is upregulated in response to oncogenic RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling and oxidative stress, as its transcription is directly stimulated by the AP-1 (JUN:FOS) transcription factor. IGFBP7 negatively regulates RAS-RAF (BRAF)-MAPK signaling and is important for the establishment of senescence in melanocytes (Wajapeyee et al. 2008).<p>Please refer to Young and Narita 2009 for a recent review.''',

RNA Polymerase I Transcription produces the large preribosomal RNA transcript (45S pre-rRNA) that is processed to yield 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, and 5.8S rRNA, accounting for about half the RNA in a cell. RNA Polymerase II transcription produces messenger RNAs (mRNA) as well as a subset of non-coding RNAs including many small nucleolar RNAs (snRNA) and microRNAs (miRNA). RNA Polymerase III Transcription produces transfer RNAs (tRNA), 5S RNA, 7SL RNA, and U6 snRNA. Transcription from mitochondrial promoters is performed by the mitochondrial RNA polymerase, POLRMT, to yield long transcripts from each DNA strand that are processed to yield 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, tRNAs, and a few RNAs encoding components of the electron transport chain. Regulation of gene expression can be divided into epigenetic regulation, transcriptional regulation, and post-transcription regulation (comprising translational efficiency and RNA stability). Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is the result of heritable chemical modifications to DNA and DNA-binding proteins such as histones. Epigenetic changes result in altered chromatin complexes that influence transcription. Gene Silencing by RNA mostly occurs post-transcriptionally but can also affect transcription. Small RNAs originating from the genome (miRNAs) or from exogenous RNA (siRNAs) are processed and transferred to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which interacts with complementary RNA to cause cleavage, translational inhibition, or transcriptional inhibition.''',
    8853720: '''N-Glycosylation is one of the most common co- and posttranslational modifications of eukaryotic proteins occurring in the ER lumen. N-glycosylation plays pivotal roles in protein folding and intra- or inter-cellular trafficking of N-glycosylated proteins. Quality control mechanisms in the ER sift out incorrectly-folded proteins from correctly-folded proteins, the former then destined for degradation. Incorrectly-folded N-glycans are exported to the cytosol where the process of degradation begins. Once the unfolded protein is cleaved from the oligosaccharide (forming free oligosaccharides, fOS), step-wise degradation of mannose moieties, both in the cytosol (Suzuki & Harada 2014) and then in the lysosome (Aronson & Kuranda 1989, Winchester 2005), results in complete degradation. Breakdown must be complete to avoid lysosomal storage diseases that occur when fragments as small as dimers are left undigested.''',

    1636575: '''Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are long, unbranched polysaccharides containing a repeating disaccharide unit composed of a hexosamine (either N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) or N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)) and a uronic acid (glucuronate or iduronate). They can be heavily sulfated. GAGs are located primarily in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and on cell membranes, acting as a lubricating fluid for joints and as part of signalling processes. They have structural roles in connective tissue, cartilage, bone and blood vessels (Esko et al. 2009). GAGs are degraded in the lysosome as part of their natural turnover. Defects in the lysosomal enzymes responsible for the metabolism of membrane-associated GAGs lead to lysosomal storage diseases called mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS). MPSs are characterised by the accumulation of GAGs in lysosomes resulting in chronic, progressively debilitating disorders that in many instances lead to severe psychomotor retardation and premature death (Cantz & Gehler 1976, Clarke 2008). The biosynthesis and breakdown of the main GAGs (hyaluronate, keratan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate) is described here.''',
    9021667: '''NOTCH3 receptor can be activated by DLL/JAG ligands DLL1, JAG1, and JAG2 (Shimizu et al. 2000), as well as DLL4 (Claxton and Fruttiger 2004, Indraccolo et al. 2009). Ligand binding induces a conformational change in NOTCH3, which exposes the S2 site in the extracellular region of NOTCH3. The S2 site is cleaved by ADAM10 metalloprotease, generating the membrane anchored NOTCH3 fragment NEXT3. The NEXT3 fragment of NOTCH3 is further cleaved at the S3 site by the gamma secretase complex, releasing the intracellular domain NICD3 into the cytosol (Groot et al. 2014). Besides DLL/JAG ligands, NOTCH3 signaling can also be activated by binding of NOTCH3 to YBX1 (YB 1) (Rauen et al. 2009). NICD3 traffics to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor. WWP2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, negatively regulates NOTCH3 signaling by ubiquitinating NEXT3 and NICD3 in the cytosol and targeting them for lysosome-mediated degradation (Jung et al. 2014). NOTCH3 signaling is also negatively regulated by binding to TACC3 (Bargo et al. 2010) and by EGFR-mediated phosphorylation (Arasada et al. 2014).''',

    2160869: '''Hyaluronan (HA) turnover can occur locally at the tissue of origin, where it is taken up by cells to be degraded, or released into the lymphatic and vascular systems, where it can be eliminated by the liver and kidneys. Uptake of HA into cells for degradation involves receptor-mediated processes. Once HA enters lysosomes, the acidic conditions favour hyaluronidases to cleave it into small oligosaccharides, the most common size being a tetrasaccharide. Beta-glucuronidases participate in degrading the small oligosaccharides in the lysosome. Ultimately, HA is degraded into its constituent sugars (glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine) which can be used to reform many glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) when released from the lysosome.<br>A third of the total HA content in humans is turned over daily and it has a short half life of minutes in circulation up to days in many tissues. The reasons why the body eliminates HA so rapidly are unknown but one possible explanation could be HA's role as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger. Removing these toxic compounds could explain the rapid elimination of HA (Lepperdinger et al. 2004, Menzel & Farr 1998, Erickson & Stern 2012, Stern 2003).''',

CO2 bound as carbamate to the N-terminus of hemoglobin and protons (H+) bound to histidine residues in hemoglobin are released as hemoglobin (HbA) binds O2. Bicarbonate (HCO3-) present in plasma is taken up by erythrocytes via the band3 anion exchanger (AE1, SLC4A1) and combined with H+ by carbonic anhydrases I and II (CA1/CA2) to yield water and CO2 (Reviewed by Esbaugh and Tufts 2006).

    350438: '''To perform many of their functions, cell structures often require not only positional but also vectorial information.  This form of polarisation is usually referred to as planar cell polarity (PCP) or tissue polarity.  In Drosophila, PCP can easily be seen on several external adult structures such as the precisely aligned hairs on wing cells and in the arrangement of the building blocks, the ommatidia, of the compound eye.<br><br>In the wing blade, each cell grows a distally pointing, actin-rich hair close to its distal vertex.  The hair orientation process relies solely on directional cytoskeletal rearrangements without an apparent requirement for a transcriptional response.  A more complex polarisation is to be found in the eye.  Within each ommatidium, the rhabdomeres of the six outer (R1 to R6) and two inner (R7 and R8) photoreceptors are organised into a trapezoid pattern that is invariant between ommatidia.  In addition, the ommatidia are aligned with respect to the anterior-posterior and dorso-ventral axes.  The cell fate specification of the R3 and R4 photoreceptors is key to the precise ommatidial polarity.  PCP mediated competition between R3 and R4 results in expression of target gene Delta (DL) in the R3 cell.  The ligand DL binds to its receptor Notch (N), thus activating the Notch signalling pathway, in the neighbouring R4 cell.  The resulting R3 against R4 cell fate now determines the direction of rotation and positioning of the photoreceptors in the mature cluster.<br><br>In both Drosophila wing and eye the PCP mechanism can be basically generalised in the following way.<br><br>The core components of PCP signalling interact to establish polarity in the cell or set of cells.  This results in polarised localisation and activation of associated cytoplasmic components.  These direct the PCP 'signal' to a variety of downstream effectors.  The core components include the membrane localised atypical cadherin Starry Night (STAN) aka Flamingo (Fmi), the seven-pass transmembrane protein Frizzled (FZ), the four-pass transmembrane protein Van Gogh (VANG) aka Strabismus (Stbm), along with with the prenylated LIM domain protein Prickle (PK) aka Spiny Legs, Dishevelled (DSH) and the ankyrin repeat protein Diego (DGO) which are present in the cytoplasm but associate with the membrane.<br><br>There is also a second group of PCP regulators including the atypical cadherins Dachsous (DS) and Fat (FT) along with the type II transmembrane protein Four-jointed (FJ).  It appears that FJ is at its most active in the Golgi. FJ genetically interacts with DS and FT (FJ -> DS -> FT).  It's proposed that it may promote or mediate post-translational modification of these atypical cadherins.  However, the large size of DS and FT means analysis of potential post-translational modifications is difficult (Strutt et al., 2004).<br><br>In each cell, before the onset of PCP signalling, STAN, FZ, VANG, DS, and FT are uniformly distributed on the cell surface with PK, DSH, and DGO present in the cytoplasm.  During PCP signalling, DS binds to FT in an adjacent cell (heterophillic protein-protein interaction) along with STAN binding to its neighbour in the adjacent cell (homophillic protein-protein interaction).  Polarisation of the PCP components along the proximal-distal and R3-R4 cell boundaries now occurs as part of a bistable switch mechanism.  FZ recruits DSH and DGO to the R3/Distal cell boundary while VANG recruits PK to the R4/Proximal cell boundary.  It is believed that there is an interaction (mutual recruitment) between STAN:FZ:DSH:DGO complexes on one side and STAN:VANG:PK complexes on the adjacent cell surface.  It is controversial to say whether communication is mediated via STAN homodimers, or through a direct contact between FZ and VANG.  However, both these complexes antagonise each other, thus inhibiting formation of the oppositely orientated complex.  This leads to asymmetric enrichment and distribution of the main PCP components.  The FZ:DSH:DGO complex becomes enriched at the Distal/R3 cell boundary while the proteins that function as antagonists of FZ, the VANG:PK complex becomes enriched at the Proximal/R4 boundary.  STAN becomes enriched on both sides, probably stabilising both complexes.<br><br>PK can also interact with DSH, causing a reduction of DSH membrane localisation.  This can be seen as a negative feedback loop.  However, DGO can compete with PK for DSH binding and so remove the inhibitory action of PK on PCP signalling.  DGO stabilises the FZ:DSH complex and the signal now appears to branch with DSH interacting with both RHO1 and RAC1 small GTPases.<br><br>In the RHO1 branch, RHO1 binds to DSH via the Dishevelled Associated Activator of Morphogenesis bridging protein (DAAM) and becomes activated.  Activated RHO1 (the GTP-bound form) binds Rho kinase (ROK) which becomes activated.  Non-muscle Myosin II is a hexamer composed of two of each of the following: heavy chain Zipper (ZIP), regulatory light chain Spaghetti squash (SQH), and the essential light chain MLC-C.  Myosin phosphatase is a heterotrimer composed of a protein phosphatase catalytic subunit Flapwing (FLW) or PP1-87B; a Myosin phosphatase targeting subunit, Myosin binding subunit (MBS) or MYPT-75D; and a small subunit of unknown function sometimes referred to as M20.  Activated ROK phosphorylates SQH, this leads to a change in the conformation and increase in ATPase catalytic activity of ZIP.  Multivalent bipolar filaments are more readily formed which are more capable of binding multiple actin filaments.  However, Myosin phosphatase dephosphorylates SQH leading to the inactivation of non-muscle Myosin II.  Myosin phosphatase is itself negatively regulated through phosphorylation of MBS by ROK.  Thus, ROK doubly activates non-muscle Myosin II by direct phosphorylation of SQH and inactivation of Myosin phosphatase by phosphorylating MBS.<br><br>Additionally, in the wing, proximally localised VANG acts via the Planar Polarity Effector (PPE) proteins Inturned (IN), Fuzzy (FY), and Fritz (FRTZ) to stabilise the formin inhibitor protein, multiple wing hairs (MWH) resulting in the regulation of actin polymerisation and its inherent effect on hair formation.<br><br>In the RAC1 branch, after DSH binds to RAC1 there is genetic evidence to suggest that the JNK signalling cascade is activated by the STE20 kinase Misshapen (MSN).  The MKK7 orthologue Hemipterous (HEP) is phosphorylated by components downstream of RAC1.  Additionally, components from the RHO1 branch, FLW, MBS, and ZIP, appear to interact genetically with members of the JNK pathway, namely Basket (BSK), HEP, and Puckered (PUC).  Nonmuscle myosin acts upstream, mediating an activating signal on JNK.''',
    964840: '''After the transport of the glycoprotein to the cis-Golgi, the pathway of N-glycosylation bifurcates. Some N-glycans can be moved to subsequent steps of the secretory pathway without further modifications, or alternatively, with the removal of a few mannoses (Oligo Mannoses pathway). In yeast and other unicellular species, a series of mannose residues are added (High Mannoses pathway). The presence of this modification is a major obstacle to the production of pharmaceutical drugs in yeast, where the HighMannose pathway must be inhibited or modified in order to avoid the presence of high mannose xenoglycans.<br>The first N-glycan modification step is the trimming of up to four mannoses by one of three mannosidase enzymes.

    1566961: '''Elastic fibres (EF) are a major structural constituent of dynamic connective tissues such as large arteries and lung parenchyma, where they provide essential properties of elastic recoil and resilience. EF are composed of a central cross-linked core of elastin, surrounded by a mesh of microfibrils, which are composed largely of fibrillin. In addition to elastin and fibrillin-1, over 30 ancillary proteins are involved in mediating important roles in elastic fibre assembly as well as interactions with the surrounding environment. These include fibulins, elastin microfibril interface located proteins (EMILINs), microfibril-associated glycoproteins (MAGPs) and Latent TGF-beta binding proteins (LTBPs). Fibulin-5 for example, is expressed by vascular smooth muscle cells and plays an essential role in the formation of elastic fibres through mediating interactions between elastin and fibrillin (Yanigasawa et al. 2002, Freeman et al. 2005). In addition, it plays a role in cell adhesion through integrin receptors and has been shown to influence smooth muscle cell proliferation (Yanigasawa et al. 2002, Nakamura et al. 2002). EMILINs are a family of homologous glycoproteins originally identified in extracts of aortas. Found at the elastin-fibrillin interface, early studies showed that antibodies to EMILIN can affect the process of elastic fibre formation (Bressan et al. 1993). EMILIN1 has been shown to bind elastin and fibulin-5 and appears to coordinate their common interaction (Zanetti et al. 2004). MAGPs are found to co-localize with microfibrils. MAGP-1, for example, binds strongly to an N-terminal sequence of fibrillin-1. Other proteins found associated with microfibrils include vitronectin (Dahlback et al. 1990).<br><br>Fibrillin is most familiar as a component of elastic fibres but microfibrils with no elastin are found in the ciliary zonules of the eye and invertebrate circulatory systems. The addition of elastin to microfibrils is a vertebrate adaptation to high pulsatile pressures in their closed circulatory systems (Faury et al. 2003). Elastin appears to have emerged after the divergence of jawless vertebrates from other vertebrates (Sage 1982). <br><br>Fibrillin-1 is the major structural component of microfibrils. Fibrillin-2 is expressed earlier in development than fibrillin-1 and may be important for elastic fiber formation (Zhang et al. 1994). Fibrillin-3 arose as a duplication of fibrillin-2 that did not occur in the rodent lineage. It was first isolated from human brain (Corson et al. 2004).<br><br>Fibrillin assembly is not as well defined as elastin assembly. The primary structure of fibrillin is dominated by calcium binding epidermal growth factor like repeats (Kielty et al. 2002). Fibrillin may form dimers or trimers before secretion. However, multimerisation predominantly occurs outside the cell. Formation of fibrils appears to require cell surface structures suggesting an involvement of cell surface receptors. Fibrillin is assembled pericellularly (i.e. on or close to the cell surface) into microfibrillar arrays that undergo time dependent maturation into microfibrils with beaded-string appearance. Transglutaminase forms gamma glutamyl epsilon lysine isopeptide bonds within or between peptide chains. Additionally, intermolecular disulfide bond formation between fibrillins is an important contributor to fibril maturation (Reinhardt et al. 2000).<br><br>Models of fibrillin-1 microfibril structure suggest that the N-terminal half of fibrillin-1 is asymmetrically exposed in outer filaments, while the C-terminal half is buried in the interior (Kuo et al. 2007). Fibrillinopathies include Marfan syndrome, familial ectopia lentis, familial thoracic aneurysm, all due to mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene FBN1,  and congenital contractural arachnodactyly which is caused by mutation of FBN2 (Maslen & Glanville 1993, Davis & Summers 2012).<br><br>In vivo assembly of fibrillin requires the presence of extracellular fibronectin fibres (Sabatier et al. 2009). Fibrillins have Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequences that interact with integrins (Pfaff et al. 1996, Sakamoto et al. 1996, Bax et al., 2003, Jovanovic et al. 2008) and heparin-binding domains that interact with a cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (Tiedemann et al. 2001) possibly a syndecan (Ritty et al. 2003). Fibrillins also have a major role in binding and sequestering growth factors such as TGF beta into the ECM  (Neptune et al. 2003). Proteoglycans such as versican (Isogai et al. 2002), biglycan, and decorin (Reinboth et al. 2002) can interact with the microfibrils. They confer specific properties including hydration, impact absorption, molecular sieving, regulation of cellular activities, mediation of growth factor association, and release and transport within the extracellular matrix (Buczek-Thomas et al. 2002). In addition, glycosaminoglycans have been shown to interact with tropoelastin through its lysine side chains (Wu et al. 1999), regulating tropoelastin assembly (Tu & Weiss 2008).<br><br>Elastin is synthesized as a 70kDa monomer called tropoelastin, a highly hydrophobic protein composed largely of two types of domains that alternate along the polypeptide chain. Hydrophobic domains are rich in glycine, proline, alanine, leucine and valine. These amino acids occur in characteristic short (3-9 amino acids) tandem repeats, with a flexible and highly dynamic structure (Floquet et al. 2004). Unlike collagen, glycine in elastin is not rigorously positioned every 3 residues. However, glycine is distributed frequently throughout all hydrophobic domains of elastin, and displays a strong preference for inter-glycine spacing of 0-3 residues (Rauscher et al. 2006). <br><br>Elastic fibre formation involves the deposition of tropoelastin onto a template of fibrillin rich microfibrils. Recent results suggest that the first step of elastic fiber formation is the organization of small globules of elastin on the cell surface followed by globule aggregation into microfibres (Kozel et al. 2006). An important contribution to the initial stages assembly is thought to be made by the intrinsic ability of the protein to direct its own polymeric organization in a process termed 'coacervation' (Bressan et al. 1986). This self-assembly process appears to be determined by interactions between hydrophobic domains (Bressan et al. 1986, Vrhovski et al. 1997,  Bellingham et al. 2003, Cirulis & Keeley 2010) which result in alignment of the cross-linking domains, allowing the stabilization of elastin through the formation of cross-links generated through the oxidative deamination of lysine residues, catalyzed by members of the lysyl oxidase (LOX) family (Reiser et al. 1992, Mithieux & Weiss 2005). The first step in the cross-linking reaction is the oxidative formation of the delta aldehyde, known as alpha aminoadipic semialdehyde or allysine (Partridge 1963). Subsequent reactions that are probably spontaneous lead to the formation of cross-links through dehydrolysinonorleucine and allysine aldol, a trifunctional cross-link dehydromerodesmosine and two tetrafunctional cross-links desmosine and isodesmosine (Lucero & Kagan 2006), which are unique to elastin. These cross-links confer mechanical integrity and high durability. In addition to their role in self-assembly, hydrophobic domains provide elastin with its elastomeric properties, with initial studies suggesting that the elastomeric propereties of elastin are driven through changes in entropic interactions with surrounding water molecules (Hoeve & Flory 1974). <br><br>A very specific set of proteases, broadly grouped under the name elastases, is responsible for elastin remodelling (Antonicelli et al. 2007). The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are particularly important in elastin breakdown, with MMP2, 3, 9 and 12 explicitly shown to degrade elastin (Ra & Parks 2007). Nonetheless, elastin typically displays a low turnover rate under normal conditions over a lifetime (Davis 1993).''',
    1566970: '''Fibronectin (FN1) is found in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of all cells as linear and branched networks that surround and connect neighbouring cells (Singh et al. 2010). Prior to matrix formation FN1 exists as a protein dimer. Often the two peptide chains represent differentially-spliced variants. The chains are linked by a pair of C-terminal disulfide bonds which are essential for subsequent multimerization (Schwarzbaur 1991). FN1 monomers have a molecular weight of 230-270 kDa depending on alternative splicing and contain three types of repeating unit, I, II, and III. I and II are stabilized by intra-chain disulfide bonds. The absence of disulfide bonds in type III modules allows them to partially unfold under applied force (Erickson 2002). Three regions of variable splicing occur along the length of the FN1 monomer (Mao & Schwarzbauer 2005). One or both of the 'extra' type III modules EIIIA and EIIIB may be present in cellular FN1, but never in plasma FN1. A variable (V) region exists between the 14th and 15th type III module. This contains the binding site for alpha4 beta1 and alpha4beta7 integrins. It is present in most cellular FN1, occasionally in plasma FN1. The modules are arranged into several functional and protein-binding domains. There are four FN1-binding domains (Mao & Schwarzbauer 2005). One of these domains (I1-5), referred to as the 'assembly domain', is required for the initiation of FN1 matrix assembly. Modules III9-10 correspond to the 'cell-binding domain' of FN1. The Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) integrin binding sequence located in III10 is the primary site of FN1 to cell attachment, mediated predominantly by alpha5 beta1 and alphaV beta3 integrins. The 'synergy site' in III9 modulates FN1's association with alpha5 beta1 integrins.  FN1 also contains interaction domains for fibrin (I1-5, I10-12), collagen (I6-9, II1-2), fibulin-1 (III13-14), heparin, syndecan (III12-14) and fibrillin-1 (I6-9) (Mao & Schwartzbauer 2005, Sabatier et al. 2009).<br><br> FN1 dimer binding to alpha5beta1 integrin stimulates self-association. Binding is thought to lead to a conformational change in FN1 that triggers the addition of further FN1 dimers (Singh et al. 2010). I1-5 functions as a unit that is the primary FN1 matrix assembly domain (Sottile et al. 1991) but other units are likely to be involved (Singh et al. 2010), the process is not fully understood.<br><br>Several ECM proteins appear to require the FN1 matrix for their own assembly. Fibrillin-1 containing microfibrils are formed when fibrillin-1 multimers bind to the FN1 matrix (Sabatier et al. 2009). FN1 polymerization promotes the deposition of type I and type III collagen (Sottile and Hocking 2002, Velling et al. 2002). Inhibition of FN1 polymerization increases its turnover and a concomitant loss of collagen types I and III from the ECM (Sottile and Hocking 2002, Sottile et al. 2007). FN1 is regulated by matrix metalloproteinases, particularly MMP14 (Shi & Sottile 2011).''',
    9013501: '''Similar to NOTCH1, NOTCH3 is activated by delta-like and jagged ligands (DLL/JAG) expressed in trans on a neighboring cell. The activation triggers cleavage of NOTCH3, first by ADAM10 at the S2 cleavage site, then by gamma-secretase at the S3 cleavage site, resulting in the release of the intracellular domain of NOTCH3, NICD3, into the cytosol. NICD3 subsequently traffics to the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional regulator. NOTCH3 expression pattern is more restricted than the expression patterns of NOTCH1 and NOTCH2, with predominant expression of NOTCH3 in vascular smooth muscle cells, lymphocytes and the nervous system (reviewed by Bellavia et al. 2008). Based on the study of Notch3 knockout mice, Notch3 is not essential for embryonic development or fertility (Krebs et al. 2003).<p><p>Germline gain-of-function NOTCH3 mutations are an underlying cause of the CADASIL syndrome - cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy. CADASIL is characterized by degeneration and loss of vascular smooth muscle cells from the arterial wall, predisposing affected individuals to an early onset stroke (Storkebaum et al. 2011). NOTCH3 promotes survival of vascular smooth muscle cells at least in part by induction of CFLAR (c FLIP), an inhibitor of FASLG activated death receptor signaling. The mechanism of NOTCH3 mediated upregulation of CFLAR is unknown; it is independent of the NOTCH3 coactivator complex and involves an unelucidated crosstalk with the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway (Wang et al. 2002).<p><p>In rat brain, NOTCH3 and NOTCH1 are expressed at sites of adult neurogenesis, such as the dentate gyrus (Irvin et al. 2001). NOTCH3, similar to NOTCH1, promotes differentiation of the rat adult hippocampus derived multipotent neuronal progenitors into astroglia (Tanigaki et al. 2001). NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3, and their ligand DLL1 are expressed in neuroepithelial precursor cells in the neural tube of mouse embryos. Together, they signal to inhibit neuronal differentiation of neuroepithelial precursors. Expression of NOTCH3 in mouse neuroepithelial precursors is stimulated by growth factors BMP2, FGF2, Xenopus TGF beta5 - homologous to TGFB1, LIF, and NTF3 (Faux et al. 2001).<p>In mouse telencephalon, NOTCH3, similar to NOTCH1, promotes radial glia and neuronal progenitor phenotype. This can, at least in part be attributed to NOTCH mediated activation of RBPJ-dependent and HES5-dependent transcription (Dang et al. 2006).<p>In mouse spinal cord, Notch3 is involved in neuronal differentiation and maturation. Notch3 knockout mice have a decreased number of mature inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord, which may be involved in chronic pain conditions (Rusanescu and Mao 2014).<p><p>NOTCH3 amplification was reported in breast cancer, where NOTCH3 promotes proliferation and survival of ERBB2 negative breast cancer cells (Yamaguchi et al. 2008), and it has also been reported in ovarian cancer (Park et al. 2006).

    190719: '''The mechanism of connexin assembly into connexons has been well characterized. Two different types of connexons can be formed. A connexon containing six identical connexin molecules is referred to as an homomeric connexon, while a connexon containing at least two different connexin molecules is referred to as an heteromeric connexon. The connexin molecules making up an heteromeric connexon appear to belong to only one subgroup (alpha or beta); heteromeric connexons containing both alpha and beta subunits have not yet been observed. Indeed, an intrinsic signal in four amino acid positions appears to confer different physicochemical characteristics to certain connexins in the alpha and beta groups (Lagr et al., 2003). These intrinsic signals are Cx specific, however (see Gemel et al., 2006). Therefore, additional yet unknown signals are required to regulate connexin compatibility and hetero-oligomerization. <br>The identification of the subcellular location at which gap junction assembly occurs has proven difficult. One explanation for this difficulty may be that the location of oligomerization  for each connexon varies depending upon Cx type or cell type.

    76049: '''There are three basic types of RNA polymerase III promoters.  The three types of RNA polymerase III promoters are known as type 1, type 2, and type 3 promoters.  Type 1 promoters are found in the 5S genes and consist of a gene-internal element called the internal control region (ICR), that is subdivided into A block, intermediate element, and C block (Bogenhagen, 1985; Sakonju et al., 1980).  Type 2 promoters are found in tRNA genes, Adenovirus 2 VAI gene, and other genes (Galli et al., 1981; Sharp et al., 1981).  These promoters consists of two gene-internal elements called the A and the B boxes.  Type 3 promoters consist of a distal sequence element (DSE) that serves as an enhancer, a proximal sequence element (PSE), and a TATA box (Baer et al., 1989; Lobo and Hernandez, 1989). <p>Some promoters combine elements from type 2 and 3 promoters.

    3451158: '''Once in the nucleus, beta-catenin is recruited to WNT target genes through interaction with TCF/LEF transcription factors. This family, which consists of TCF7 (also known as TCF1), TCF7L1 (also known as TCF3), TCF7L2 (also known as TCF4) and TCF7L3 (also known as LEF1), are HMG-containing transcription factors that bind to the WNT responsive elements in target gene promoters (reviewed in Brantjes et al, 2002).  In the absence of WNT signal, TCF/LEF proteins recruit Groucho/TLE repressors to inhibit transcription; upon WNT stimulation, beta-catenin can displace Groucho/TLE from TCF/LEF proteins to initiate transcriptional activation (reviewed in Chen and Courey, 2000).  Although this model for WNT-dependent activation of target genes is widely accepted, it is important to note that TCF/LEF proteins are not redundant and can contribute to WNT target gene expression in a number of different ways (reviewed in Brantjes et al, 2002; MacDonald et al, 2009).  In particular, TCF7L1 (TCF3) is thought to have a more pronounced repressor function than other TCF/LEF family members.  A couple of recent studies in Xenopus and mammalian cells show that WNT- and beta-catenin-dependent phosphorylation of TCF7L1(TCF3) promotes its dissociation from the promoter of target genes and allows gene expression through relief of this repression activity (Hikasa et al, 2010; Hikasa et al, 2011).<br><br><br>The role of beta-catenin at WNT promoters hinges upon its ability to act as a scaffold for the recruitment of other proteins. The structure of beta-catenin consists of 12 imperfect ARM repeats (R1-12) flanked by an N-terminal and C-terminal extension (NTD and CTD respectively), with a conserved Helix C located between R12 and the CTD.  Nuclear beta-catenin interacts with TCF/LEF at WNT target genes through ARM domains 3-9 (Graham et al, 2000; Poy et al, 2001; Xing et al, 2008).  The N and the C terminal regions are important for the recruitment of transcriptional activator and repressors that contribute to WNT target gene expression (reviewed in Mosimann et al, 2009; Valenta et al, 2012).  The N-terminal ARM domains 1-4 recruit the WNT-pathway specific activators BCL9:PYGO while the C-terminal region (R11-CTD) interacts with a wide range of general transcriptional activators that are involved in chromatin remodelling and transcription initiation. These include HATs such as P300, CBP and TIP60, histone methyltransferases such as MLL1 and 2, SWI/SNF factors BRG1 and ISWI and components of the PAF complex (reviewed in Mosimann et al, 2009; Valenta et al, 2012).  Although many binding partners have been identified for the C-terminal region of beta-catenin, in many cases the timing and relationship of these interactions and indeed, the exact complex composition remains to be elucidated.  Moreover, because many of the interacting partners appear to bind to overlapping regions of beta-catenin, it is unlikely that they all bind simultaneously.  For simplicity, the interactions have been depicted as though they occur independently of one another; more accurately they are likely to cycle successively on and off beta-catenin to promote an active chromatin structure (reviewed in Willert and Jones, 2006; Valenta et al, 2012).''',

In the lung, SLC34A2 is expressed only in alveolar type II cells, which are responsible for surfactant production, so it is proposed that it uptakes liberated phosphate from the alveolar fluid for surfactant production. SLC34A2 cotransports divalent phosphate (HPO4(2-)) with three Na+ ions (electrogenic transport) from the extracellular region into alveolar type II cells. Defects in SLC34A2 can cause pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis (PALM; MIM:265100), a rare disease characterised by the deposition of calcium phosphate microliths (tiny, roundish corpuscles) throughout the lung.

This destabilization is achieved by disrupting complex formation between TSC1 and TSC2 and inducing ubiquination of the free TSC2 (Inoki et al. 2002). Phosphorylation of complexed TSC2 by PKB induces degradation of both TSC1 and TSC2 through the proteosome pathway (Dan et al. 2002). Phosphorylation of complexed TSC2 by PKB may therefore result in the dissociation of the TSC1:TSC2 complex (Proud 2002).''',

    428413: '''Commissural axons project to the floor plate, attracted by the interaction of their DCC receptors with Netrin-1 (NTN1) produced by floor plate cells (Dickson and Gilestro 2006) and radial glia (Dominici et al. 2017, Varadarajan et al. 2017). Once an axon enters the floor plate, it must be efficiently expelled on the contralateral side. A switch from attraction to repulsion allows commissural axons to enter and then leave the CNS midline. Based on studies in Xenopus neurons and by yeast two hybrid screens, it is observed that the attractive response of axons to netrins is silenced by activation of ROBO. SLIT bound ROBO binds to DCC, preventing it from transducing an attractive response to netrin. The sensitivity of axons to the repulsive action of SLIT does not only depend on repulsive SLIT receptors (ROBO1 and ROBO2), but is also influenced by expression of ROBO3, a SLIT receptor that suppresses the activity of ROBO1 and ROBO2. Upon crossing the midline, commissural axons downregulate expression of ROBO3 and increase expression of ROBO1/ROBO2 (reviewed by Dickson and Gilestro, 2006). Two transcript variants of ROBO3, ROBO3.1 and ROBO3.2 are considered to play different roles in midline crossing. ROBO3.1 is expressed in the pre-crossing and crossing commissural axons, while ROBO3.2, generated by alternative splicing, is expressed after midline crossing and thought to block midline re-crossing (Chen et al. 2008). In addition to SLITs, a secreted ligand NELL2 also acts as an axonal guidance cue that, by acting through ROBO3 receptors, helps to steer commissural axons to the midline. Both ROBO3.1 and ROBO3.2 can bind to a secreted ligand NELL2. Pre-crossing commissural axons, which express ROBO3.1, are repelled by NELL2. Post-crossing axons, which express ROBO3.2 are not repelled by NELL2 (Jaworski et al. 2015). .  ''',

    5364099: '''Receptor-interacting kinase protein 1 (RIPK1) and RIPK3-dependent necrosis is called necroptosis or programmed necrosis. The kinase activities of RIPK1 and RIPK3 are essential for the necroptotic cell death in human, mouse cell lines and genetic mice models (Cho YS et al. 2009; He S et al. 2009, 2011; Zhang DW et al. 2009; McQuade T et al. 2013; Newton et al. 2014). The initiation of necroptosis can be stimulated by the same death ligands that activate apoptosis, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, Fas ligand (FasL), and TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) or toll like receptors 3 and 4 ligands (Holler N et al. 2000; He S et al. 2009; Feoktistova M et al. 2011; Voigt S et al. 2014). In contrast to apoptosis, necroptosis represents a form of cell death that is optimally induced when caspases are inhibited (Holler N et al. 2000; Hopkins?Donaldson S et al. 2000; Sawai H 2014). Specific inhibitors of caspase-independent necrosis, necrostatins, have recently been identified (Degterev A et al. 2005, 2008). Necrostatins have been shown to inhibit the kinase activity of RIPK1 (Degterev A et al. 2008). Importantly, cell death of apoptotic morphology can be shifted to a necrotic phenotype when caspase 8 activity is compromised, otherwise active caspase 8 blocks necroptosis by the proteolytic cleavage of RIPK1 and RIPK3 (Kalai M et al. 2002; Degterev A et al. 2008; Lin Y et al. 1999; Feng S et al. 2007). When caspase activity is inhibited under certain pathophysiological conditions or by pharmacological agents, deubiquitinated RIPK1 is engaged in physical and functional interactions with its homolog RIPK3 leading to formation of necrosome, a necroptosis-inducing complex consisting of RIPK1 and RIPK3 (Sawai H 2013; Moquin DM et al. 2013; Kalai M et al. 2002; Cho YS et al. 2009, He S et al. 2009, Zhang DW et al. 2009). Within the necrosome RIPK1 and RIPK3 bind to each other through their RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) domains. The RHIMs can facilitate RIPK1:RIPK3 oligomerization, allowing them to form amyloid?like fibrillar structures (Li J et al. 2012). RIPK3 in turn interacts with mixed lineage kinase domain?like protein (MLKL) (Sun L et al. 2012; Zhao J et al. 2012). The complex of RIPK1:RIPK3:MLKL is crucial for an execution phase of necroptosis which is strictly dependent on RIPK3-mediated phosphorylation of MLKL followed by MLKL oligomerization and translocation to membrane surfaces (Sun L et al. 2012; Wang H et al. 2014). Immunoblot analysis of cell fractions obtained by differential centrifugation of human colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT29) whole cell extracts suggests that upon necroptosis RIPK1:RIPK3:MLKL complexes shift to the plasma membrane and membranous organelles such as mitochondria, lysosome, endosome and ER (Wang H et al. 2014). These findings are supported by immunofluorescent imaging of subcellular distribution of necrosome components expressed in human cells (Wang H et al. 2014; Cai Z et al. 2014). The mechanisms of necroptosis regulation and execution downstream of MLKL remain elusive. MLKL has been proposed to induce necrosis execution in human cells (shown for HeLA and HT29 cell lines) by binding and activating phosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5) resulting in the induction of mitochondrial fission (Wang Z et al 2012). However, other studies showed that PGAM5-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation was dispensable for RIP?mediated necrosis in mouse cells (Murphy et al. 2013, Remijsen Q et al. 2014; Moujalled DM et al. 2014). Moreover, mitochondria-depleted 3T3 mouse embryo fibroblast cells were found to undergo necroptosis, suggesting that mitochondria axis may not be required for this process  (Tait SW et al. 2013). Finally, RIPK3-activated MLKL has been also reported to translocate to lipid rafts of the plasma membrane where it facilitate cell death through membrane permeabilization (Cai Z et al. 2014; Dondelinger Y et al. 2014).<p>The Reactome module describes MLKL-mediated necroptotic events on the plasma membrane.''',

    186761: '''Regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity is implicated in the control of almost all cellular functions. One of the best understood RTKs is epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Growth factors can bind to EGFR and activate it to initiate signalling cascades within the cell. EGFRs can also be recruited to clathrin-coated pits which can be internalised into endocytic vesicles. From here, EGFRs can either be recycled back to the plasma membrane or directed to lysosomes for destruction.This provides a mechanism by which EGFR signalling is negatively regulated and controls the strength and duration of EGFR-induced signals. It also prevents EGFR hyperactivation as commonly seen in tumorigenesis.<br><br>The proto-oncogene Cbl can negatively regulate EGFR signalling. The Cbl family of RING-type ubiquitin ligases are able to poly-ubiquitinate EGFR, an essential step in EGFR degradation. All Cbl proteins have a unique domain that recognises phosphorylated tyrosine residues on activated EGFRs. They also direct the ubiquitination and degradation of activated EGFRs by recruiting ubiquitin-conjugation enzymes. Cbl proteins function by specifically targeting activated EGFRs and mediating their down-regulation, thus providing a means by which signaling processes can be negatively regulated.<br><br>Cbl also promotes receptor internalization via it's interaction with an adaptor protein, CIN85 (Cbl-interacting protein of 85kDa).

The proline-rich region of CIN85 interacts with endophilins which are regulatory components of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). Endophilins bind to membranes and induce membrane curvature, in conjunction with other proteins involved in CCV formation.

Fe-S protein biogenesis in the mitochondrial matrix involves the iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly machinery. Ferrous iron is transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix by Mitoferrin-1 (SLC25A37) and Mitoferrin-2 (SLC25A28). (Mitoferrin-1 is enriched in erythroid cells while Mitoferrin-2 is ubiquitous.) Frataxin binds ferrous iron in the mitochondrial matrix. The cysteine desulfurase NFS1 in a subcomplex with ISD11 provides the sulfur by converting cyteine into alanine and forming a persulfide which is used for cluster formation on ISCU, the scaffold protein. Interaction between NFS1 and ISD11 is necessary for desulfurase activity. Frataxin binds to a complex containing NFS1, ISD11, and ISCU and is proposed to function as an iron donor to ISCU or as an allosteric switch that activates sulfur transfer and Fe-S cluster assembly (Tsai and Barondeau 2010). Cluster formation also involves the electron transfer chain ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin. ISCU initially forms clusters containing 2 iron atoms and 2 sulfur atoms ([2Fe-2S] clusters). They are released by the function of HSP70-HSC20 chaperones and the monothiol glutaredoxin GLRX5 and used for assembly of [2Fe-2S] proteins.

Bacteria in infected individuals, however, are typically confined to the lining of the throat or to a skin lesion; systemic effects are due to the secretion of an exotoxin encoded by a lysogenic bacteriophage. The toxin is encoded as a single polypeptide but is cleaved by host furin-like proteases to yield an aminoterminal fragment A and a carboxyterminal fragment B, linked by a disulfide bond. Toxin cleavage can occur when it first contacts the target cell surface, as annotated here, or as late as the point at which fragment A is released into the cytosol. Fragment B mediates toxin uptake into target cell endocytic vesicles, where acidification promotes a conformational change enabling fragment B to form a channel in the vesicle membrane through which fragment A is extruded into the target cell cytosol. Cleavage of the inter-fragment disulfide bond frees DT fragment A, which catalyzes ADP ribosylation of the translation elongation factor 2 (EEF2) in a target cell, thereby blocking protein synthesis.

Members of the four enzyme families differ in their tissue-specific expression patterns and in their substrate preferences (chain length, degree of saturation), leading to tissue-specific complements of VLCA (Jakobsson et al. 2006; Kihara 2012; Nugteren 1965).<p>Here the full two-carbon elongation cycle to form stearate from palmitate is annotated, as well as the activation and condensation steps for elongation of arachidonate, the 20-carbon unsaturated fatty acid that plays a central role in the synthesis of prostaglandins and related hormones.''',

Compromised immune response may present itself as either overactivity or underactivity of the immune system leading to a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes that can be categorized into four main groups - autoimmunity, immunodeficiency (ID) with a greater susceptibility to infectious diseases, hypersensitivity to compounds that are usually not harmful and malignancy. Several host conditions may cause the dysfunctional immunity. Among them are inherited and somatic mutations found in the components of immune signaling pathways.

    387504: '''Mammalian Olfactory Receptor (OR) genes were discoved in rats by Linda Buck and Richard Axel, who predicted that odorants would be detected by a large family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are selectively expressed in the olfactory epithelium. This prediction was based on previous biochemical evidence that cAMP levels increased in olfactory neurons upon odor stimulation. These predictions proved to be true, and Buck and Axel received a Nobel Prize for this and subsequent work (reviewed in Keller & Vosshall 2008).<br><br>Subsequent work in mice and other vertebrates has confirmed that OR genes are comprised of a very large family of G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) that are selectively-expressed in olfactory epithelium. Although some OR are also expressed selectively in one or a few other tissues, their expression in olfactory-epithelium generally indicates a functional role in mediating olfaction, where they couple binding by odorant ligands with intracellular olfactory signaling. (Note: the other subclasses of GPCR signaling pathways are described under "GPCR Signaling".)<br><br>The ligands for ORs are diverse, ranging from chemical compounds to peptides. Intracellular signaling by OR proteins in mice and other mammalian systems is known to be mediated via direct interactions of OR proteins with an olfactory specific heterotrimeric G Protein, that contains an olfactory-specific G alpha protein: G alpha S OLPH (also named "GNAL").<p>There are two models for GPCR-G Protein interactions: 1) ligand-GPCR binding first, then binding to G Proteins; 2) "Pre-coupling" of GPCRs and G Proteins before ligand binding (Oldham & Hamm 2008). Both models may be true for certain GPCRs in different contexts. Pre-coupling is likely to be functionally important, as pre-coupling of receptor and G Protein allows much more rapid kinetic response once ligand is bound, because the ligand-bound receptor is immediately able to transduce the signal, rather than having to diffuse around within the plasma membrane until it encounters a G Protein to interact with (Oldham & Hamm 2008).<p>The pre-coupling model is used here to characterise the reaction of the human ORs with G Proteins in the absence of ligand, because the ligands in humans are almost completely undocumented experimentally.<p>In model genetic systems such as mice, many candidate OR genes have been shown experimentally to function in olfactory signaling (reviewed in (Keller & Vosshall 2008). For the human OR genes, experimental analysis has been much more limited, although some specific OR genes, such as OR7D4 and OR11H7P have been confirmed to mediate olfactory response and signaling in humans for specific chemical odorants (Keller et al. 2007, Abbafy 2007). Mice and other rodents are believed to have about 1000 functional OR genes, as well as many additional pseudogenes.  Based on sequence similarities, there are 960 human OR genes, but approximately half of these are pseudogenes (Keller 2008). In mice, essentially all olfactory signaling requires G-alpha-S (OLF); mouse G-OLF knockouts have been shown to lack olfactory responses (Belluscio 1998). Bona fide human OR genes identified by sequence similarity (not pseudogenes with function-blocking mutations) that are expressed in olfactory epithelium are expected to interact with G alpha S OLF containing G Protein trimers. <br><br>Of the 960 human OR genes and pseudogenes, there is experimental evidence that indicates over 430 are expressed in human olfactory epithelium, including 80 expressed OR pseudogenes (Zhang 2007).

When expressed in model cell systems mammalian odorant receptors (OR) are typically retained in the ER and degraded by the proteasome (McClintock et al. 1997). A study using Caenorhabditis elegans showed that the transport of ORs to the cilia of olfactory neurons required the expression and association of ORs with a transmembrane protein, ODR4 (Dwyer et al. 1998). Co-transfection of rat ORs with ODR4 enhanced the transport and expression of ORs at the cell-surface (Gimelbrant et al. 2001). These studies suggested that olfactory neurons might have a selective molecular machinery that promotes expression of ORs at the cells surface. Two human protein families have been identified as potential accessory proteins involved in the trafficking of ORs to the plasma membrane (Saito et al. 2004). Receptor transporting proteins 1 and 2 (RTP1, RTP2) both strongly induced expression of several ORs at the cell-surface. To a lesser extent, the receptor expression enhancing protein 1 (REEP1) also promoted cell-surface expression. These proteins are specifically expressed in olfactory neurons with no expression in testis, where a subset of ORs are expressed (Parmentier et al. 1992, Spehr et al. 2003). Other members of the RTP and REEP families have a widespread distribution. RTP3 and RTP4 have been shown to promote cell-surface expression of the bitter taste receptors, TAS2Rs (Behrens et al. 2006). REEP1 and REEP5 (also known as DP1) are involved in shaping the ER by linking microtubule fibers to the ER (Park et al. 2010, Voeltz et al. 2006). A recent study looking at the role of REEP in the trafficking of Alpha2A- and Alpha2C-adrenergic receptors showed that REEP1-2 and 6 enhance the cell-surface expression of Alpha2C, but not Alpha2A, by increasing the capacity of ER cargo, thereby allowing more receptors to reach the cell-surface (Bjork et al. 2013). Unlike RTP1, REEP1-2 and 6 are only present in the ER, do not traffic to the plasma membrane and specifically interact with the minimal/non-glycosylated forms of Alpha2C via an interaction with its C-terminus (Saito et al. 2004, Bjork et al. 2013). REEPs may function as general modulators of the ER, rather than specifically interacting with GPCRs. Loss of association of REEP2 with membranes leads to hereditary spastic paraplegia (Esteves et al. 2014).''',
    141744: '''The crosslinked fibrin multimers in a clot are broken down to soluble polypeptides by plasmin, a serine protease. Plasmin can be generated from its inactive precursor plasminogen and recruited to the site of a fibrin clot in two ways, by interaction with tissue plasminogen activator at the surface of a fibrin clot, and by interaction with urokinase plasminogen activator at a cell surface. The first mechanism appears to be the major one responsible for the dissolution of clots within blood vessels. The second, although capable of mediating clot dissolution, may normally play a major role in tissue remodeling, cell migration, and inflammation (Chapman 1997; Lijnen 2001).<br>Clot dissolution is regulated in two ways. First, efficient plasmin activation and fibrinolysis occur only in complexes formed at the clot surface or on a cell membrane - proteins free in the blood are inefficient catalysts and are rapidly inactivated. Second, both plasminogen activators and plasmin itself are inactivated by specific serpins, proteins that bind to serine proteases to form stable, enzymatically inactive complexes (Kohler and Grant 2000).<br>These events are outlined in the drawing: black arrows connect the substrates (inputs) and products (outputs) of individual reactions, and blue lines connect output activated enzymes to the other reactions that they catalyze.''',

    212977: '''Resolution of AP sites can occur through the single nucleotide replacement pathway or through the multiple nucleotide patch replacement pathway, also known as the long-patch base excision repair (BER). Except for the APEX1-independent resolution of AP sites via single nucleotide base excision repair mediated by NEIL1 or NEIL2 (Wiederhold et al. 2004, Das et al. 2006), single nucleotide and multiple-nucleotide patch replacement pathways are both initiated by APEX1-mediated displacement of DNA glycosylases and cleavage of the damaged DNA strand by APEX1 immediately 5' to the AP site (Wilson et al. 1995, Bennett et al. 1997, Masuda et al. 1998). The BER proceeds via the single nucleotide replacement when the AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) deoxyribose residue at the 5' end of the APEX1-created single strand break (SSB) (5'dRP) can be removed by the 5'-exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase beta (POLB) (Bennett et al. 1997). POLB fills the created single nucleotide gap by adding a nucleotide complementary to the undamaged DNA strand to the 3' end of the SSB. The SSB is subsequently ligated by DNA ligase III (LIG3) which, in complex with XRCC1, is recruited to the BER site by an XRCC1-mediated interaction with POLB (Kubota et al. 1996). BER proceeds via the multiple-nucleotide patch replacement pathway when the AP residue at the 5' end of the APEX1-created SSB undergoes oxidation-related damage (5'ddRP) and cannot be cleaved by POLB (Klungland and Lindahl 1997). Long-patch BER can be completed by POLB-mediated DNA strand displacement synthesis in the presence of PARP1 or PARP2, FEN1 and DNA ligase I (LIG1) (Prasad et al. 2001). When the PCNA-containing replication complex is available, as is the case with cells in S-phase of the cell cycle, DNA strand displacement synthesis is catalyzed by DNA polymerase delta (POLD) or DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) complexes, in the presence of PCNA, RPA, RFC, APEX1, FEN1 and LIG1 (Klungland and Lindahl 1997, Dianova et al. 2001). It is likely that the 9-1-1 repair complex composed of HUS1, RAD1 and RAD9 interacts with and coordinates components of BER, but the exact mechanism and timing have not been elucidated (Wang et al. 2004, Smirnova et al. 2005, Guan et al. 2007, Balakrishnan et al. 2009).

Proteomic analyses indicate that SUMO is conjugated to hundreds of proteins and most targets of SUMOylation are nuclear (Vertegal et al. 2006, Bruderer et al. 2011, Tatham et al. 2011, Da Silva et al. 2012, Becker et al. 2013).<br>UBE2I (UBC9), the E2 activating enzyme of the SUMO pathway, is itself also a SUMO E3 ligase. Most SUMOylation reactions will proceed with only the substrate protein and the UBE2I:SUMO thioester conjugate. The rates of some reactions are further enhanced by the action of other E3 ligases such as RANBP2. These E3 ligases catalyze SUMO transfer to substrate by one of two basic mechanisms: they interact with both the substrate and UBE2I:SUMO thus bringing them into proximity or they enhance the release of SUMO from UBE2I to the substrate.<br>Most SUMOylation reactions occur in the nucleoplasm therefore most targets of SUMOylation are nuclear proteins such as transcription factors, transcription cofactors, and nuclear receptors.

Most SUMO2 and SUMO3 is unconjugated in unstressed cells and becomes conjugated to target proteins in response to stress (Golebiowski et al. 2009).

    5364156: '''Necrosis has traditionally been considered as a passive, unregulated cell death. However, accumulating evidence suggests that necrosis, like apoptosis, can be executed by genetically controlled and highly regulated cellular process that is morphologically characterized by a loss of cell membrane integrity, intracellular organelles and/or the entire cell swelling (oncosis) (Rello S et al. 2005; Galluzzi L et al. 2007; Berghe TV et al. 2014). The morphological hallmarks of the nectotic death have been associated with different forms of programmed cell death including (but not limited to) parthanatos, necroptosis, glutamate-induced oxytosis, ferroptosis, inflammasome-mediated necrosis etc. Each of them can be triggered under certain pathophysiological conditions. For example UV, ROS or alkylating agents may induce poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) hyperactivation (parthanatos), while tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or toll like receptor ligands (LPS and dsRNA) can trigger necrosome-mediated necroptosis. The initiation events, e.g., PARP1 hyperactivation, necrosome formation, activation of NADPH oxidases, in turn trigger one or several common intracellular signals such as NAD+ and ATP-depletion, enhanced Ca2+ influx, dysregulation of the redox status, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activity of phospholipases. These signals affect cellular organelles and membranes leading to osmotic swelling, massive energy depletion, lipid peroxidation and the loss of lysosomal membrane integrity. Regulated or programmed necrosis eventually leads to cell lysis and release of cytoplasmic content into the extracellular region that is often associated with a tissue damage resulting in an intense inflammatory response.<p>The Reactome module describes necroptosis as the most characterized form of regulated necrosis. The molecular mechanisms behind the other types of regulated necrosis as well as interconnectivity among them need further studies.''',
    9017788: '''MECP2 is an X chromosome gene whose loss-of-function mutations are an underlying cause of the majority of Rett syndrome cases. The MECP2 gene locus consists of four exons. Both exon 1 and exon 2 contain translation start sites. Alternative splicing of the second exon results in expression of two MECP2 transcript isoforms, MECP2_e1 (MECP2B or MECP2alpha) and MECP2_e2 (MECP2A or MECP2beta). The N-terminus of the MECP2_e1 isoform, in which exon 2 is spliced out, is encoded by exon 1. The N-terminus of the MECP2_e2 isoforms, which includes both exon 1 and exon 2, is encoded by exon 2, as the exon 2 translation start site is used. Exons 3 and 4 are present in both isoforms. The MECP2_e2 isoform was cloned first and is therefore more extensively studied. The MECP2_e1 isoform is more abundant in the brain (Mnatzakanian et al. 2004, Kriaucionis and Bird 2004, Kaddoum et al. 2013). Mecp2 isoforms show different expression patterns during mouse brain development and in adult brain regions (Dragich et al. 2007, Olson et al. 2014). While Rett syndrome mutations mainly occur in exons 3 and 4 of MECP2, thereby affecting both MECP2 isoforms (Mnatzakanian et al. 2004), some mutations occur in exon 1, affecting MECP2_e1 only. No mutations have been described in exon 2 (Gianakopoulos et al. 2012). Knockout of Mecp2_e1 isoform in mice, through a naturally occurring Rett syndrome point mutation which affects the first translation codon of MECP2_e1, recapitulates Rett-like phenotype. Knockout of Mecp2_e2 isoform in mice does not result in impairment of neurologic functions (Yasui et al. 2014). In Mecp2 null mice, transgenic expression of either Mecp2_e1 or Mecp2_e2 prevents development of Rett-like phenotype, with Mecp2_e1 rescuing more Rett-like symptoms than Mecp2_e2. This indicates that both splice variants can fulfill basic Mecp2 functions in the mouse brain (Kerr et al. 2012). Changes in gene expression upon over-expression of either MECP2_e1 or MECP2_e2 imply overlapping as well as distinct target genes (Orlic-Milacic et al. 2014).<p>Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 encoded by the MECP2 gene binds to methylated CpG sequences in the DNA. The binding is not generic, however, but is affected by the underlying DNA sequence (Yoon et al. 2003). MECP2 binds to DNA containing 5 methylcytosine (5mC DNA), a DNA modification associated with transcriptional repression (Mellen et al. 2012), both in the context of CpG islands and outside of CpG islands (Chen et al. 2015). In addition, MECP2 binds to DNA containing 5 hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC DNA), a DNA modification associated with transcriptional activation (Mellen et al. 2012). MECP2 binds to DNA as a monomer, occupying about 11 bp of the DNA. Binding of one MECP2 molecule facilitates binding of the second MECP2 molecule, and therefore clustering can occur at target sites. MECP2 binding to chromatin may be facilitated by nucleosome methylation (Ghosh et al. 2010).<p>MECP2 was initially proposed to act as a generic repressor of gene transcription. However, high throughput studies of MECP2-induced changes in gene expression in mouse hippocampus (Chahrour et al. 2008), and mouse and human cell lines (Orlic-Milacic et al. 2014) indicate that more genes are up-regulated than down-regulated when MECP2 is overexpressed. At least for some genes directly upregulated by MECP2, it was shown that a complex of MECP2 and CREB1 was involved in transcriptional stimulation (Chahrour et al. 2008, Chen et al. 2013).<p>MECP2 expression is the highest in postmitotic neurons compared to other cell types, with MECP2 being almost as abundant as core histones. Phosphorylation of MECP2 in response to neuronal activity regulates binding of MECP2 to DNA, suggesting that MECP2 may remodel chromatin in a neuronal activity-dependent manner. The resulting changes in gene expression would then modulate synaptic plasticity and behavior (reviewed by Ebert and Greenberg 2013). In human embryonic stem cell derived Rett syndrome neurons, loss of MECP2 is associated with a significant reduction in transcription of neuronally active genes, as well as the reduction in nascent protein synthesis. The reduction in nascent protein synthesis can at least in part be attributed to the decreased activity of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Neuronal morphology (reduced soma size) and the level of protein synthesis in Rett neurons can be ameliorated by treating the cells with growth factors which activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade or by inhibition of PTEN, the negative regulator of AKT activation. Mitochondrial gene expression is also downregulated in Rett neurons, which is associated with a reduced capacity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (Ricciardi et al. 2011, Li et al. 2013). Treatment of Mecp2 null mice with IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) reverses or ameliorates some Rett-like features such as locomotion, respiratory difficulties and irregular heart rate (Tropea et al. 2009).<p>MECP2 regulates expression of a number of ligands and receptors involved in neuronal development and function. Ligands regulated by MECP2 include BDNF (reviewed by Li and Pozzo-Miller 2014, and KhorshidAhmad et al. 2016), CRH (McGill et al. 2006, Samaco et al. 2012), SST (Somatostatin) (Chahrour et al. 2008), and DLL1 (Li et al. 2014). MECP2 also regulates transcription of genes involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA – GAD1 (Chao et al. 2010) and GAD2 (Chao et al. 2010, He et al. 2014). MECP2 may be involved in direct stimulation of transcription from the GLUD1 gene promoter, encoding mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase 1, which may be involved in the turnover of the neurotransmitter glutamate (Livide et al. 2015). Receptors regulated by MECP2 include glutamate receptor GRIA2 (Qiu et al. 2012), NMDA receptor subunits GRIN2A (Durand et al. 2012) and GRIN2B (Lee et al. 2008), opioid receptors OPRK1 (Chahrour et al. 2008) and OPRM1 (Hwang et al. 2009, Hwang et al. 2010, Samaco et al. 2012), GPRIN1 (Chahrour et al. 2008), MET (Plummer et al. 2013), NOTCH1 (Li et al. 2014). Channels/transporters regulated by MECP2 include TRPC3 (Li et al. 2012) and SLC2A3 (Chen et al. 2013). MECP2 regulates transcription of FKBP5, involved in trafficking of glucocorticoid receptors (Nuber et al. 2005, Urdinguio et al. 2008). MECP2 is implicated in regulation of expression of SEMA3F (semaphorin 3F) in mouse olfactory neurons (Degano et al. 2009). In zebrafish, Mecp2 is implicated in sensory axon guidance by direct stimulation of transcription of Sema5b and Robo2 (Leong et al. 2015). MECP2 may indirectly regulate signaling by neuronal receptor tyrosine kinases by regulating transcription of protein tyrosine phosphatases, PTPN1 (Krishnan et al. 2015) and PTPN4 (Williamson et al. 2015).<p>MECP2 regulates transcription of several transcription factors involved in functioning of the nervous system, such as CREB1, MEF2C, RBFOX1 (Chahrour et al. 2008) and PPARG (Mann et al. 2010, Joss-Moore et al. 2011).<p>MECP2 associates with transcription and chromatin remodeling factors, such as CREB1 (Chahrour et al. 2008, Chen et al. 2013), the HDAC1/2-containing SIN3A co-repressor complex (Nan et al. 1998), and the NCoR/SMRT complex (Lyst et al. 2013, Ebert et al. 2013). There are contradictory reports on the interaction of MECP2 with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex (Harikrishnan et al. 2005, Hu et al. 2006). Interaction of MECP2 with the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 has been reported, with a concomitant increase in enzymatic activity of DNMT1 (Kimura and Shiota 2003).<p>In addition to DNA binding-dependent regulation of gene expression by MECP2, MECP2 may influence gene expression by interaction with components of the DROSHA microprocessor complex and the consequent change in the levels of mature microRNAs (Cheng et al. 2014, Tsujimura et al. 2015).<p>Increased MECP2 promoter methylation is observed in both male and female autism patients (Nagarajan et al. 2008). Regulatory elements that undergo methylation are found in the promoter and the first intron of MECP2 and their methylation was shown to regulate Mecp2 expression in mice (Liyanage et al. 2013). Mouse Mecp2 promoter methylation was shown to be affected by stress (Franklin et al. 2010).<p>The Rett-like phenotype of Mecp2 null mice is reversible (Guy et al. 2007), but appropriate levels of Mecp2 expression need to be achieved (Alvarez-Saavedra et al. 2007). When Mecp2 expression is restored in astrocytes of Mecp2 null mice, amelioration of Rett symptoms occurs, involving non-cell-autonomous positive effect on mutant neurons and increasing level of the excitatory glutamate transporter VGLUT1 (Lioy et al. 2011). Microglia derived from Mecp2 null mice releases higher than normal levels of glutamate, which has toxic effect on neurons. Increased glutamate secretion may be due to increased levels of glutaminase (Gls), involved in glutamate synthesis, and increased levels of connexin-32 (Gjb1), involved in glutamate release, in Mecp2 null microglia (Maezawa and Jin 2010). Targeted deletion of Mecp2 from Sim1-expressing neurons of the mouse hypothalamus recapitulates some Rett syndrome-like features and highlights the role of Mecp2 in feeding behavior and response to stress (Fyffe et al. 2008).<p>Mecp2 overexpression, similar to MECP2 duplication syndrome, causes neurologic phenotype similar to Rett (Collins et al. 2004, Luikenhuis et al. 2004, Van Esch et al. 2005, Alvarez-Saavedra 2007, Van Esch et al. 2012). The phenotype of the mouse model of the MECP2 duplication syndrome in adult mice is reversible when Mecp2 expression levels are corrected (Sztainberg et al. 2015). ''',

Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA (MPS IIIA, Sanfilippo syndrome A, MIM:252900) is a rare, autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease characterised by severe CNS degeneration in early childhood leading to death between 10 and 20 years of age. A deficiency of the enzyme N-sulphoglucosamine sulphohydrolase (SGSH, MIM:605270), which normally hydrolyses the sulfate group from the terminal N-sulphoglucosamine residue of heparan sulfate (HS), leads to the build-up of HS in cells and tissues and its presence in urine (van de Kamp et al. 1981, Yogalingam & Hopwood 2001, de Ruijter et al. 2011). The gene encoding N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase, SGSH, was cloned in 1995 (Scott et al.1995) and, later, shown to contain 8 exons spanning approximately 11 kb (Karageorgos et al. 1996).''',

In LBs, surfactant proteins and lipids are assembled into bilayer membranes that are secreted into the alveolar airspace, where they form a surface film at the air–liquid interface. Defects in ABCA3 can cause pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction 3 (SMDP3), a usually fatal pulmonary disease in newborns, characterised by the absence of normal LBs and the presence of electron-dense inclusions within small vesicular structures. Loss of secretion of lipid pulmonary surfactants causes excessive lipoprotein accumulation in the alveoli resulting in severe respiratory distress (Shulenin et al. 2004, Quazi & Molday 2011, Tarling et al. 2014, Whitsett et al. 2015).''',
    5577147: '''The normal sequence of contraction of atria and ventricles of the heart require activation of groups of cardiac cells. The mechanism must elicit rapid changes in heart rate and respond to changes in autonomic tone. The cardiac action potential controls these functions. Action potentials are generated by the movement of ions through transmembrane ion channels in cardiac cells. Like skeletal myocytes (and axons), in the resting state, a given cardiac myocyte has a negative membrane potential. In both muscle types, after a delay (the absolute refractory period), K+ channels reopen and the resulting flow of K+ out of the cell causes repolarisation. The voltage-gated Ca2+ channels on the cardiac sarcolemma membrane are generally triggered by an influx of Na+ during phase 0 of the action potential. Cardiac muscle cells are so tightly bound that when one of these cells is excited the action potential spreads to all of them. The standard model used to understand the cardiac action potential is the action potential of the ventricular myocyte (Park & Fishman 2011, Grant 2009).<br><br>The action potential has 5 phases (numbered 0-4). Phase 4 describes the membrane potential when a cell is not being stimulated. The normal resting potential in the ventricular myocardium is between -85 to -95 mV. The K+ gradient across the cell membrane is the key determinant in the normal resting potential. Phase 0 is the rapid depolarisation phase in which electrical stimulation of a cell opens the closed, fast Na+ channels, causing a large influx of Na+ creating a Na+ current (I<sub>Na+</sub>). This causes depolarisation of the cell. The slope of phase 0 represents the maximum rate of potential change and differs in contractile and pacemaker cells. Phase 1 is the inactivation of the fast Na+ channels. The transient net outward current causing the small downward deflection (the "notch" of the action potetial) is due to the movement of K+ and Cl- ions. In pacemaker cells, this phase is due to rapid K+ efflux and closure of L-type Ca2+ channels. Phase 2 is the plateau phase which is sustained by a balance of Ca2+ influx and K+ efflux. This phase sustains muscle contraction. Phase 3 of the action potential is where a concerted action of two outward delayed currents brings about repolarisation back down to the resting potential (Bartos et al. 2015).''',
    432584: '''The Drosophila molecular circadian clock consists of two main interlocked sets of transcription/translation feedback loops.  These both contain protein and mRNA components that cycle in abundance and subcellular localisation with a near 24 hour period.  Within the core components of the clock pathway, both loops drive rhythmic transcription in the opposite phase to each other.<br><br>The pathways shown below are most representative of those occurring in key clock neurons within the brains of adult flies kept under standard 12 hour light:12 hour dark cycles at 25&deg;C.  Differences in one or more of the biochemical steps shown here and/or reactions not shown here can occur in different brain clock neurons (about 150 total cells per adult brain) and within the same clock cells as a function of changes in environmental conditions, such as day-length or temperature.<br><br>Starting from midday and continuing through to early night, the <I>per/tim</I> feedback loop is initiated when the basic-helix-loop-helix/PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) domain transcription factors, Clock (CLK) and Cycle (CYC), form heterodimers and bind E-box regulatory elements to activate transcription of target genes <I>per</I>, <I>tim</I>, <I>vri</I>, and <I>Pdp1</I>.  The levels of <I>per</I> and <I>tim</I> mRNA transcripts peak early in the night, whereas Period (PER) and Timeless (TIM) proteins do not reach peak abundance levels until mid-to-late evening.  TIM stays at low levels at this point because it is destabilised by light.  PER is phosphorylated by Discs overgrown (DCO) kinase aka Double-time (DBT) and Casein kinase II (CK2).  Without TIM, which stabilises it, PER is targeted for degradation by the 26S proteasome via an interaction with the F-box containing protein, supernumerary limbs (SLMB).  In addition, PER is stabilised by the protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 while TIM is similarly stabilised by PP1 phosphatase.  The coordinated action of both kinases and phosphatases, during this part of the day, keep PER at low levels and in a hypophosphorylated state, as hyperphosphorylated PER is removed due to low TIM levels.<br><br>After dusk during the early night, <I>per</I> and <I>tim</I> mRNA transcripts reach peak levels.  TIM abundance begins to increase in the dark and forms a complex with PER.  This, along with PP1 phosphatase, stabilises PER despite its continued phosphorylation by kinases.  As a result PER and TIM accumulate to high levels during the middle of the night.  TIM is then phosphorylated by CK2.  PER and TIM dissociate, PER (in complex with DCO) enters the nucleus followed by TIM, a few hours later.  Once in the nucleus PER and TIM reform their heterodimer and bind to the CLK:CYC heterodimer, so repressing the transcription of <I>per</I>, <I>tim</I>, <I>vri</I>, and <I>Pdp1</I>.  The CLK:CYC heterodimer is removed from the E-boxes and sequestered in a stable complex with PER and TIM to reinforce the transcription inhibition.  In addition, DCO bound to PER phosphorylates CLK.  Towards the end of the night PER and TIM proteins are at their peak level.<br><br>At dawn, the introduction of light recalibrates the circadian clock.  The blue-light photoreceptor cryptochrome (CRY) experiences a light-induced conformational change which forms a complex with hyperphosphorylated TIM, which leads to both TIM and CRY degradation by the 26S proteasome via an interaction with the F-box containing protein Jetlag (JET).  PER and CLK, hyperphosphorylated by DCO, the former no longer protected by TIM, are also degraded during the early morning.  PER levels fall to their lowest level around midday, however, CLK levels remain constant since hypophosphorylated CLK is generated from new CLK protein expression or dephosphorylation of hyperphosphorylated CLK by PP2A protein phosphatase.  Hypophosphorylated CLK then forms a heterodimer with CYC, binds to E-boxes of its target genes and a new cycle of <I>per</I>, <I>tim</I>, <I>vri</I>, and <I>Pdp1</I> transcription is initiated.  There is an alternate view that CLK binds to CYC then CLK is phosphorylated in the cytosol.  This promotes nuclear entry followed by further CLK phosphorylation.  However, this string of events at present remain controversial and are not included in the current model.<br><br>There is a second feedback loop, the <I>Clk</I> loop, interlocked with the <I>per/tim</I> feedback loop.  As mentioned above, at midday CLK:CYC heterodimers bind to the E-boxes and activate transcription of the target genes <I>vri</I> and <I>Pdp1</I>, which lead to the production of the proteins Vrille (VRI) and PAR domain protein-1 (PDP1) respectively.  PDP1 activates transcription of <I>Clk</I> and <I>cry</I> genes, while VRI represses it, by competitively binding to regulatory sequences called VRI/PDP1 (V/P) boxes.  Although <I>vri</I> mRNA accumulates in phase with <I>per</I> and <I>tim</I> mRNAs, <I>Pdp1</I> accumulation is delayed by several hours.  In contrast to the delayed accumulation of PER and TIM protein levels, VRI protein levels rise in sync with <I>vri</I> mRNA.  Between midday and dusk, VRI levels rise, and the superior VRI/PDP1 ratio means it predominantly binds to the V/P boxes to repress <I>Clk</I> and <I>cry</I> transcription.  VRI levels reach their peak during the early night after dusk coinciding with minimal levels of <I>Clk</I> and <I>cry</I> mRNAs.  However, CRY protein levels build slowly as it is relatively stable in the dark.<br><br>PDP1 levels reach their peak between mid to late night.  VRI levels decline during this time due to TIM:PER influenced repression of <I>vri</I> transcription.  The decreasing ratio of VRI/PDP1 levels favours binding of PDP1 to the V/P boxes resulting in activation of <I>Clk</I> and <I>cry</I> transcription.  PDP1 protein levels start to decline during the late night and are low by the early morning.  However, despite this, PDP1 continues to activate <I>Clk</I> and <I>cry</I> transcription until midday when VRI protein levels are sufficient, after the next cycle of CLK:CYC mediated transcription, to take over the binding of the V/P boxes and repress transcription.<br><br>Recently, CLK:CYC transcription of some new target genes and their associated feedback loops have come to light such as the <I>cwo</I> gene and its protein product clockwork orange (CWO).  However, there is confusion as to whether CWO, which binds to the E-boxes of <I>per</I>, <I>tim</I>, <I>vri</I>, and <I>Pdp1</I> activates or represses their transcription.  There are likely to be many more of these secondary transcription loops connected to the core clock mechanism to add yet more modes of regulation.''',

    391640: '''Cellular insults causing DNA damage can be of varied origins: endogenous production of oxygen free radicals, normal alkylation reactions, or exposure to exogenous radiation and chemicals. Double strand breaks (DSBs), one of the most dangerous types of DNA damage, are caused by ionizing radiation or certain chemicals such as bleomycin, and also occur normally during the processes of DNA replication, meiotic exchange, and V(D)J recombination. Two distinct mechanisms for DSB repair are the error-free homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway and the error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. The choice of pathway may be determined by whether the DNA region has already replicated and the precise nature of the break. NHEJ functions at all stages of the cell cycle, but plays the predominant role in the G1 phase and in early S phase, when the lack of a duplicated sister chromosome prevents repair by HRR. In contrast, HRR functions primarily in repairing DSBs that occur either during the act of DNA replication, or DSBs that occur in late S or G2 phase in chromosomal regions that have already been replicated.''',

Binding of an antigen to an antibody of the IgM or IgG class induces a conformational change in the Fc domain of the antibody that allows it to bind to the C1q component of C1. C1 activation requires interaction with two separate Fc domains, so pentavalent IgM antibody is far more efficient at complement activation than IgG antibody. Antibody binding results in a conformational change in the C1r component of the C1 complex and a proteolytic cleavage of C1r, activating it.

Contrary to the classical NHEJ and other HDR pathways, homologous recombination repair (HRR) and single strand annealing (SSA), MMEJ does not require ATM activation. In fact, ATM activation inhibits MMEJ. Therefore, MMEJ may be triggered when the amount of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) overwhelms DNA repair machinery of higher fidelity or when cells are deficient in components of high fidelity DNA repair.<p>MMEJ is initiated by a limited resection of DNA DSB ends by the MRN complex (MRE11A:RAD50:NBN) and RBBP8 (CtIP), in the absence of CDK2-mediated RBBP8 phosphorylation and related BRCA1:BARD1 recruitment (Yun and Hiom 2009). Single strand DNA (ssDNA) at resected DNA DSB ends recruits PARP1 or PARP2 homo- or heterodimers, together with DNA polymerase theta (POLQ) and FEN1 5'-flap endonuclease. In a poorly studied sequence of events, POLQ promotes the annealing of two 3'-ssDNA overhangs through microhomologous regions that are optimally 10-19 nucleotides long. Using analogy with POLB-mediated long patch base excision repair (BER), it is plausible that PARP1 (or PARP2) dimers coordinate the extension of annealed 3'-ssDNA overhangs via POLQ-mediated strand displacement synthesis with FEN1-mediated cleavage of the resulting 5'-flaps (Liang et al. 2005, Mansour et al. 2011, Sharma et al. 2015, Kent et al. 2015, Ciccaldi et al. 2015, Mateos-Gomez et al. 2015).

MMEJ, just like classical NHEJ, can result in genomic translocations (Ghezraoui et al. 2014). In addition, since POLQ is an error-prone DNA polymerase, MMEJ introduces frequent base substitutions (Ceccaldi et al. 2015).''',

Following ATM activation and foci formation, the two-step resection is initiated by the MRN complex (MRE11A:RAD50:NBN) and RBBP8 (CtIP) associated with BRCA1:BARD1, and completed by EXO1 or DNA2 in cooperation with DNA helicases BLM, WRN and BRIP1 (BACH1) (Sartori et al. 2007, Yun and Hiom 2009, Eid et al. 2010, Nimonkar et al. 2011, Suhasini et al. 2011, Sturzenegger et al. 2014). Long 3'-ssDNA overhangs produced by extensive resection are coated by the RPA heterotrimer (RPA1:RPA2:RPA3), triggering ATR signaling. ATR signaling is needed for SSA, probably because of the related phosphorylation of RPA2 (Zou and Elledge 2003, Anantha et al. 2007, Liu et al. 2012).<p>RAD52 is the key mediator of SSA. Activated ATM phosphorylates and activates ABL1, and activated ABL1 subsequently phosphorylates pre-formed RAD52 heptameric rings, increasing their affinity for ssDNA (Honda et al. 2011). Phosphorylated RAD52 binds phosphorylated RPA heterotrimers on 3'-ssDNA overhangs at resected DNA DSBs. RAD52 also binds RAD51 and prevents formation of invasive RAD51 nucleofilaments involved in HRR (Chen et al. 1999, Van Dyck et al. 1999, Parsons et al. 2000, Jackson et al. 2002, Singleton et al. 2002).<p>RAD52 promotes annealing of two 3'-ssDNA overhangs when highly homologous directed repeats are present in both 3'-ssDNA overhangs.

The endonuclease complex composed of ERCC1 and ERCC4 (XPF) is subsequently recruited to SSA sites through direct interaction between RAD52 and ERCC4, leading to cleavage of 3' flaps (Motycka et al. 2004, Al-Minawi et al. 2008).

    5364223: '''Activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) can trigger multiple signal transduction pathways to induce inflammation, cell proliferation, survival or cell death (Ward C et al. 1999; Micheau O and Tschopp J 2003; Widera D et al. 2006). Whether a TNF-alpha-stimulated cell will survive or die is dependent on the cellular context. TNF-alpha-induced signals lead to the activation of transcriptional factors such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkappaB) and activator protein-1 (AP1) (Ward C et al. 1999; Widera D et al. 2006; Tsou HK et al. 2012).<p> The binding of TNF-alpha to TNFR1 leads to recruitment of the adapter protein TNFR1-associated death domain (TRADD) and of receptor‑interacting protein 1 (RIPK1). TRADD subsequently recruits also TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). RIPK1 is promptly K63-polyubiquitinated which results in the recruitment of the TAB2:TAK1 complex and the IkB kinase (IKK) complex to TNFR1. The activated IKK complex mediates phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NFkappaB (IkB), which targets IkB for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Released NFkappaB induces the expression of a variety of genes including inflammation-related genes and anti-apoptotic genes encoding proteins such as inhibitor of apoptosis proteins cIAP1/2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) (Blonska M et al. 2005; Ea CK et al. 2006; Wu CJ et al. 2006; Chen C et al. 2000; Manna SK et al. 2000; Kreuz S et al. 2001; Micheau O et al. 2001). NFkB-mediated inhibition of cell death also involves attenuating TNF-induced activation of c-Jun activating kinase (JNK). Whereas transient activation of JNK upon TNF treatment is associated with cellular survival, prolonged JNK activation contributes to cell death. However, as caspases activate JNK quite efficiently, JNKs are also regularly stimulated in course of apoptosis without being essential for cell death (Wicovsky A et al. 2007). AP1-mediated gene induction results from activation of JNK via TRAF2 (not shown here) (Tsou HK et al. 2012). While pro-survival signaling is initiated and regulated via the activated TNFR1 receptor complex at the cell membrane, cell death signals are induced by internalization-associated fashion upon the release of RIPK1 from the membrane complex (Micheau O and Tschopp J 2003; Schneider-Brachert W et al. 2004; Tchikov V et al. 2011).<p>TNFR1-mediated transcriptional activity of NFkB is both antiapoptotic and highly proinflammatory and thus must be tightly regulated to prevent constitutive activation that leads to persistent inflammation and cancer (Ward C et al. 1999; Fujihara S et al. 2002; Pekalski J et al. 2013; Kankaanranta H et al. 2014; Shukla S and Gupta S 2004; Jackson-Bernitsas DG et al. 2007; Zhang JY et al. 2007).

For almost all RNAs, 3'-end processing consists of two steps: (i) the mRNA is first cleaved at a particular phosphodiester bond downstream of the coding sequence, (ii) the upstream fragment then receives a poly(A) tail of approximately 250 adenylate residues, whereas the downstream fragment is degraded. The two partial reactions are coupled so that reaction intermediates are usually undetectable.  While 3' processing can be studied as an isolated event <i>in vitro</i>, it appears to be connected to transcription, splicing, and transcription termination <i>in vivo</i>.<p>The only known exception to the rule of cleavage followed by polyadenylation are the major histone mRNAs, which are cleaved but not polyadenylated.''',

In the liver, C to U editing is important in the expression of specific isoforms of the apolipoprotein B enzyme. ApoB mRNA  editing  is a posttranscriptional, nuclear process that can be initiated after splicing, at the time of polyadenylation and is completed by the time pre-mRNA matures fully (reviewed by Blanc and Davidson, 2003).<BR>This editing event is a simple hydrolytic cytidine deamination to uridine, and is carried out by the Apobec-1 enzyme, along with the Apobec-1 complementing factor, ACF.

    166412: '''MyD88-independent signaling pathway is shared by TLR3 and TLR4 cascades. TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-beta (TRIF or TICAM1) is a key adapter molecule in transducing signals from TLR3 and TLR4 in a MyD88-independent manner (Yamamoto M et al. 2003a). TRIF is recruited to ligand-stimulated TLR3 or 4 complex via its TIR domain. TLR3 directly binds TRIF (Oshiumi H et al 2003). In contrast, TLR4-mediated signaling pathway requires two adapter molecules, TRAM (TRIF-related adapter molecule or TICAM2) and TRIF. TRAM(TICAM2) is thought to bridge between the activated TLR4 complex and TRIF (Yamamoto M et al. 2003b, Tanimura N et al. 2008, Kagan LC et al. 2008).<p>TRIF recruitment to TLR complex stimulates distinct pathways leading to production of type 1 interferons (IFNs), pro-inflammatory cytokines and induction of programmed cell death.''',
    166413: '''The first known downstream component of TLR4 and TLR2 signaling is the adaptor MyD88. Another adapter MyD88-adaptor-like (Mal; also known as TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein or TIRAP) has also been described for TLR4 and TLR2 signaling. MyD88 comprises an N-terminal Death Domain (DD) and a C-terminal TIR, whereas Mal lacks the DD. The TIR homotypic interactions bring adapters into contact with the activated TLRs, whereas the DD modules recruit serine/threonine kinases such as interleukin-1-receptor-associated kinase (IRAK). Recruitment of these protein kinases is accompanied by phosphorylation, which in turn results in the interaction of IRAKs with TNF-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). The oligomerization of TRAF6 activates TAK1, a member of the MAP3-kinase family, and this leads to the activation of the IkB kinases. These kinases, in turn, phosphorylate IkB, leading to its proteolytic degradation and the translocation of NF-kB to the nucleus. Concomitantly, members of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor family, Jun and Fos, are activated, and both AP-1 transcription factors and NF-kB are required for cytokine production, which in turn produces downstream inflammatory effects.''',
    72205: '''Co-transcriptional pre-mRNA splicing is not obligatory. Pre-mRNA splicing begins co-transcriptionally and often continues post-transcriptionally. Human genes contain an average of nine introns per gene, which cannot serve as splicing substrates until both 5' and 3' ends of each intron are synthesized. Thus the time that it takes for pol II to synthesize each intron defines a minimal time and distance along the gene in which splicing factors can be recruited. The time that it takes for pol II to reach the end of the gene defines the maximal time in which splicing could occur co-transcriptionally. Thus, the kinetics of transcription can affect the kinetics of splicing.Any covalent change in a primary (nascent) mRNA transcript is mRNA Processing.  For successful gene expression, the primary mRNA transcript needs to be converted to a mature mRNA prior to its translation into polypeptide.  Eucaryotic mRNAs undergo a series of complex processing reactions; these begin on nascent transcripts as soon as a few ribonucleotides have been synthesized during transcription by RNA Polymerase II, through the export of the mature mRNA to the cytoplasm, and culminate with mRNA turnover in the cytoplasm.''',

It consists of a large number of distinct proteins, which circulate in the blood stream in functionally inactive states. When activated, complement components assemble on the surface of a target cell. The activation of one component induces its proteolytic function that acts on the next component in the cascade, cleaving it into biologically active fragments. In mammals, the complement system is activated via three distinct pathways: the classical, lectin and alternative pathways. All three pathways merge at the proteolytic cleavage of component C3 to form the key molecule C3b. The activation of the complement system leads to four principal outcomes: (1) opsonization of target cells to enhance phagocytosis (2) lysis of target cells via an assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC) on the pathogen surface (3) production of anaphylatoxins that are involved in the host inflammatory response (4) clearance of antibody-antigen complexes.<p>Avian species (chicken, turkey and duck) have been reported to induce functional complement pathways in response to immunization with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) [Ellis MG et al 1989; Koppenheffer TL et al 1999; Baelmans R et al 2005].

Immune competence of the distinct chicken ecotypes was assessed by measuring complement hemolytic activity after immunization with SRBC [Baelmans R et al 2004; Baelmans R et al 2005]. Both classical Ca2+ dependent complement pathway (CPW) and alternative calcium-independent complement pathway (APW), as well as total Ig (IgG and IgM antibody) responses were detected. However, the type and magnitude of immune response varied for individual chickens even within the same ecotype.<p>Analysis of genome data revealed that mammals and aves seem to share practically the same set of complement genes [Nonaka M and Kimura A 2006].

    2206289: '''Mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II, Hunter syndrome, MIM:309900) is an X-linked, recessive genetic disorder which therefore primarily affects males. MPS II was first described in 1917, by Major Charles Hunter (Hunter 1917) and is caused by a deficiency (or absence) of iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS, MIM:300823), which would normally hydrolyse the 2-sulfate groups of the L-iduronate 2-sulfate units of dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate and heparin. Without IDS, these GAGs accumulate in the body and are excessively excreted in urine. Although the disease was known since the early 1970s, being the first MPS to be defined clinically in humans, it wasn't until the 1990s that IDS was cloned. It is now known to be localized to Xq28 (Wilson et al. 1991) and contain 9 exons (Flomen et al. 1993) spanning approximately 24 kb (Wilson et al. 1993).<br>Build up can occur in the liver and spleen as well as in the walls and valves of the heart (reduced hepatic and cardiac function, liver/spleen hepatosplenomegaly), airways (leading to obstructive airway disease), all major joints and bones (joint stiffness and skeletal deformities) and in brain (severe mental retardation). The rate of progression and degree of severity of the disorder can be different for each person with MPS II. Severe forms of the disorder can result in death in childhood whereas those with a "milder" form can expect to live to their 20's or 30's.   Some patients even survive into their fifth and sixth decades of life (Wraith et al. 2008, Beck 2011).''',

Uptake is usually via ingestion but inhalation and transdermal routes are also common.<p><p>The very nature of many chemicals that make them suitable for uptake by these routes, in other words their lipophilicty (favours fat solubility) is also the main reason organisms have developed mechanisms that convert them to hydrophilic (favours water solubility) compounds which are readily excreted via bile and urine. Otherwise, lipophilic chemicals would accumulate in the body and overwhelm defense mechanisms. This process is called <b><i>biotransformation</i></b> and is catalyzed by enzymes mainly in the liver of higher organisms but a number of other organs have considerable ability to process xenobiotica such as kidneys, gut and lungs. As well as xenobiotics, many endogenous compounds are commonly eliminated by this process.<p><p>This mechanism is of ancient origin and a major factor for its development in animals is plants. Most animals are plant eaters and thus are subject to a huge variety of chemical compounds which plants produce to stop themselves being eaten. This complex set of enzymes have several features which make them ideal for biotransformation;<p><p><i>(<b>1</b>) metabolites of the parent chemical are usually made more water soluble so it favours rapid excretion via bile and urine</i><p><p><i>(<b>2</b>) the enzymes possess broad and overlapping specificity to be able to deal with newly exposed chemicals</i><p><p><i>(<b>3</b>) metabolites of the parent generally don't have adverse biological effects.</i><p><p>In the real world however, all these criteria have exceptions. Many chemicals are transformed into reactive metabolites. In pharmacology, the metabolites of some parent drugs exert the desired pharmacological effect but in the case of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which can undergo epoxidation, it results in the formation of an electrophile which can attack proteins and DNA.<p><p>Metabolism of xenobiotica occurs in several steps called <i><b>Phase 1 (functionalization)</b></i> and <i><b>Phase 2 (conjugation)</b></i>. To improve water solubility, a functional group is added to or exposed on the chemical in one or more steps (Phase 1) to which hydrophilic conjugating species can be added (Phase 2). Functional groups can either be electrophilic (epoxides, carbonyl groups) or nucleophilic (hydroxyls, amino and sulfhydryl groups, carboxylic  groups) <i>(see picture)</i>.<p><p>Once chemicals undergo functionalization, the electrophilic or nucleophilic species can be detrimental to biological systems. Electrophiles can react with electron-rich macromolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA by covalent interaction whilst nucleophiles have the potential to interact with biological receptors. That's why conjugation is so important as it mops up these potentially reactive species.<p><p>Many chemicals, when exposed to certain metabolizing enzymes can induce those  enzymes, a process called <i><b>enzyme induction</b></i>. The effect of this is that these chemicals accelerate their own biotransformation and excretion. The reverse is also true where some chemicals cause enzyme inhibition. Some other factors that alter enzyme levels are sex, age and genetic predisposition. Between species, there can be considerable differences in biotransformation ability which is a problem faced by drug researchers interpreting toxicological results to humans.''',

Over 60% of colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI) harbor inactivating mutations in both alleles of TGFBR2, mostly 1 or 2 bp deletions in the 10 bp adenine repeat that codes for three lysine residues in the extracellular domain of TGFBR2. These small deletions result in a frameshift and a premature stop codon (Markowitz et al. 1995). TGFBR2 kinase domain (KD) mutations are found in ~20% of microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancers and these are mostly missense mutations that results in substitution of conserved amino acids in the kinase domain (Grady et al. 1999), likely impairing the catalytic activity of TGFBR2 KD mutants.

In particular, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases MAPK3(ERK1) and MAPK1 (ERK2) are involved in diverse cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, regulation of inflammatory responses, cytoskeletal remodeling, cell motility and invasion through the increase of matrix metalloproteinase production (Viala E & Pouyssegur J 2004; Hsu MC et al. 2006; Dawson CW et al.2008; Kuriakose T et al. 2014).The canonical RAF:MAP2K:MAPK1/3 cascade is stimulated by various extracellular stimuli including hormones, cytokines, growth factors, heat shock and UV irradiation triggering the GEF-mediated activation of RAS at the plasma membrane and leading to the activation of the RAF MAP3 kinases. However, many physiological and pathological stimuli have been found to activate MAPK1/3 independently of RAF and RAS (Dawson CW et al. 2008; Wang J et al. 2009; Kuriakose T et al. 2014). For example, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but not RAF1, was reported to regulate MAP2K1/2 and MAPK1/3 (MEK and ERK) activation in rat hepatoma H4IIE and human erythroleukemia K562 cells in response to autophagy stimuli (Wang J et al. 2009).

MAP2K then phosphorylate and activate the MAPK1/3 (ERK1 and ERK2 MAPKs). Activated MAPK1/3 phosphorylate and regulate the activities of an ever growing pool of substrates that are estimated to comprise over 160 proteins (Yoon and Seger 2006). The majority of ERK substrates are nuclear proteins, but others are found in the cytoplasm and other organelles.

Catabolism of the GAGs dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, heparin, keratan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate or hyaluronan may be blocked at one or more steps, resulting in lysosomal accumulation of GAG fragments of varying size.

The E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, which is a transcriptional target of TP53, plays the main role in TP53 protein down-regulation (Wu et al. 1993). MDM2 forms homodimers and homo-oligomers, but also functions as a heterodimer/hetero-oligomer with MDM4 (MDMX) (Sharp et al. 1999, Cheng et al. 2011, Huang et al. 2011, Pant et al. 2011). The heterodimers of MDM2 and MDM4 may be especially important for downregulation of TP53 during embryonic development (Pant et al. 2011).<p>The nuclear localization of MDM2 is positively regulated by AKT- or SGK1- mediated phosphorylation (Mayo and Donner 2001, Zhou et al. 2001, Amato et al. 2009, Lyo et al. 2010). Phosphorylation of MDM2 by CDK1 or CDK2 decreases affinity of MDM2 for TP53 (Zhang and Prives 2001). ATM and CHEK2 kinases, activated by double strand DNA breaks, phosphorylate TP53, reducing its affinity for MDM2 (Banin et al. 1998, Canman et al. 1998, Khanna et al. 1998, Chehab et al. 1999, Chehab et al. 2000). At the same time, ATM phosphorylates MDM2, preventing MDM2 dimerization (Cheng et al. 2009, Cheng et al. 2011). Both ATM and CHEK2 phosphorylate MDM4, triggering MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of MDM4 (Chen et al. 2005, Pereg et al. 2005). Cyclin G1 (CCNG1), transcriptionally induced by TP53, targets the PP2A phosphatase complex to MDM2, resulting in dephosphorylation of MDM2 at specific sites, which can have either a positive or a negative impact on MDM2 function (Okamoto et al. 2002).<p>In contrast to MDM2, E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF34 (CARP1) and RFFL (CARP2) can ubiquitinate phosphorylated TP53 (Yang et al. 2007).<p>In addition to ubiquitinating MDM4 (Pereg et al. 2005), MDM2 can also undergo auto-ubiquitination (Fang et al. 2000). MDM2 and MDM4 can be deubiquitinated by the ubiquitin protease USP2 (Stevenson et al. 2007, Allende-Vega et al. 2010). The ubiquitin protease USP7 can deubiquitinate TP53, but in the presence of DAXX deubiquitinates MDM2 (Li et al. 2002, Sheng et al. 2006, Tang et al. 2006).<p>The tumor suppressor p14-ARF, expressed from the CDKN2A gene in response to oncogenic or oxidative stress, forms a tripartite complex with MDM2 and TP53, sequesters MDM2 from TP53, and thus prevents TP53 degradation (Zhang et al. 1998, Parisi et al. 2002, Voncken et al. 2005).<p>For review of this topic, please refer to Kruse and Gu 2009.

There is a considerable debate on the role of NTAL in mast cell. Depending on the circumstances, NTAL appears to have a dual role as positive and negative regulator of MC responses elicited via FCERI. Studies conducted in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) of mice lacking NTAL displayed enhanced FCERI-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates, calcium response, degranulation, and cytokine production. This indicated that NTAL negatively regulates FCERI-mediated degranulation. However, in mice lacking both LAT and NTAL showed severe block in FCERI-mediated signaling than BMMCs deficient in LAT alone, suggesting that NTAL also shares a redundant function with LAT to play a positive role (Draberova et al. 2007, Orr & McVicar. 2011, Zhu et al. 2004, Volna et al. 2004).

    8850057: '''The mammalian Golgi complex, a central hub of both anterograde and retrograde trafficking, is a ribbon of stacked cisterna with biochemically distinct compartments (reviewed in Glick and Nakano, 2009; Szul and Sztul, 2011). Anterograde cargo from the ERGIC and ER is received at the cis-Golgi, trafficked through the medial- and trans-Golgi and released through the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the endolysosomal system and the plasma membrane. Although still under debate, current models of Golgi trafficking favour the cisternal maturation model, where anterograde cargo remain associated with their original lipid membrane during transit through the Golgi and are exposed to sequential waves of processing enzymes by the retrograde movement of Golgi resident proteins. In this way, cis-cisterna mature to medial- and trans-cisterna as the early acting Golgi enzymes are replaced by later acting ones (reviewed in Pelham, 2001; Storrie, 2005; Glick and Nakano, 2009; Szul and Sztul, 2011).  More recently. a kiss-and-run (KAR) model for intra-Golgi trafficking has been proposed, which marries aspects of the cisternal maturation model with a diffusion model of transport (reviewed in Mironov et al, 2103).<br>Like the anterograde ERGIC-to Golgi transport step,  intra-Golgi trafficking between the cisterna appears to be COPI-dependent (Storrie and Nilsson, 2002; Szul and Sztul, 2011). Numerous snares and tethering complexes contribute to the targeting and fusion events that are required to maintain the specificity and directionality of these trafficking events (reviewed in Chia and Gleeson, 2014).  Golgi tethers include long coiled coiled proteins like the Golgins, as well as multisubunit tethers like the COG complex.  These tethers make numerous interactions with other components of the secretory system including RABs, SNAREs, motor and coat proteins as well as components of the cytoskeleton (reviewed in Munro, 2011; Willet et al, 2013). <br>Retrograde traffic from the cis-Golgi back to the ERGIC and ER depends on both the COPI-dependent pathway, which  appears to be important for recyling of KDEL receptors, and a more recently described COPI-independent pathway that relies on RAB6 (reviewed in Szul and Sztul, 2011; Heffernan and Simpson, 2014).

Leptin was discovered as the product of the gene affected by the ob (obesity) mutation, which causes obesity in mice. Likewise LEPR is the product of the gene affected by the db (diabetic) mutation. Leptin binding to LEPR induces canonical (JAK2/STATs; MAPK/ERK 1/2, PI-3K/AKT) and non-canonical signaling pathways (PKC, JNK, p38 MAPK and AMPK) in diverse cell types. The binding of leptin to the long isoform of LEPR (OB-Rl) initiates a phosphorylation cascade that results in transcriptional activation of target genes by STAT5 and STAT3 and activation of the PI3K pathway(not shown here), the MAPK/ERK pathway, and the mTOR/S6K pathway. Shorter LEPR isoforms with truncated intracellular domains are unable to activate the STAT pathway, but can transduce signals by way of activation of JAK2, IRS-1 or ERKs, including MAPKs.<br>LEPR is constitutively bound to the JAK2 kinase. Binding of LEP to LEPR causes a conformational change in LEPR that activates JAK2 autophosphorylation followed by phosphorylation of LEPR by JAK2. Phosphorylated LEPR binds STAT3, STAT5, and SHP2 which are then phosphorylated by JAK2. Phosphorylated JAK2 binds SH2B1 which then binds IRS1/2, resulting in phosphorylation of IRS1/2 by JAK2. Phosphorylated STAT3 and STAT5 dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they activate transcription of target genes (Jovanovic et al. 2010). SHP2 activates the MAPK pathway. IRS1/2 activate the PI3K/AKT pathway which may be the activator of mTOR/S6K.<br>Several isoforms of LEPR have been identified (reviewed in Gorska et al. 2010). The long isoform (LEPRb, OBRb) is expressed in the hypothalamus and all types of immune cells. It is the only isoform known to fully activate signaling pathways in response to leptin. Shorter isoforms (LEPRa, LEPRc, LEPRd, and a soluble isoform LEPRe) are able to interact with JAK kinases and activate other pathways, however their roles in energy homeostasis are not fully characterized.

    8936095: '''The RUNX1 (AML1) transcription factor is a master regulator of hematopoiesis (Ichikawa et al. 2004) that is frequently translocated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), resulting in formation of fusion proteins with altered transactivation profiles (Lam and Zhang 2012, Ichikawa et al. 2013). In addition to RUNX1, its heterodimerization partner CBFB is also frequently mutated in AML (Shigesada et al. 2004, Mangan and Speck 2011).<br>The core domain of CBFB binds to the Runt domain of RUNX1, resulting in formation of the RUNX1:CBFB heterodimer. CBFB does not interact with DNA directly. The Runt domain of RUNX1 mediated both DNA binding and heterodimerization with CBFB (Tahirov et al. 2001), while RUNX1 regions that flank the Runt domain are involved in transactivation (reviewed in Zhang et al. 2003) and negative regulation (autoinhibition). CBFB facilitates RUNX1 binding to DNA by stabilizing Runt domain regions that interact with the major and minor grooves of the DNA (Tahirov et al. 2001, Backstrom et al. 2002, Bartfeld et al. 2002). The transactivation domain of RUNX1 is located C-terminally to the Runt domain and is followed by the negative regulatory domain. Autoinhibiton of RUNX1 is relieved by interaction with CBFB (Kanno et al. 1998).<br>Transcriptional targets of the RUNX1:CBFB complex involve genes that regulate self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (Zhao et al. 2014), as well as commitment and differentiation of many hematopoietic progenitors, including myeloid (Friedman 2009) and megakaryocytic progenitors (Goldfarb 2009), regulatory T lymphocytes (Wong et al. 2011) and B lymphocytes (Boller and Grosschedl 2014).<br>RUNX1 binds to promoters of many genes involved in ribosomal biogenesis (Ribi) and is thought to stimulate their transcription. RUNX1 loss-of-function decreases ribosome biogenesis and translation in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). RUNX1 loss-of-function is therefore associated with a slow growth, but at the same time it results in reduced apoptosis and increases resistance of cells to genotoxic and endoplasmic reticulum stress, conferring an overall selective advantage to RUNX1 deficient HSPCs (Cai et al. 2015).<br>RUNX1 is implicated as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. RUNX1 forms a complex with the activated estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and regulates expression of estrogen-responsive genes (Chimge and Frenkel 2013).<br>RUNX1 is overexpressed in epithelial ovarian carcinoma where it may contribute to cell proliferation, migration and invasion (Keita et al. 2013).<br>RUNX1 may cooperate with TP53 in transcriptional activation of TP53 target genes upon DNA damage (Wu et al. 2013).<br>RUNX1 is needed for the maintenance of skeletal musculature (Wang et al. 2005).<br>During mouse embryonic development, Runx1 is expressed in most nociceptive sensory neurons, which are involved in the perception of pain. In adult mice, Runx1 is expressed only in nociceptive sensory neurons that express the Ret receptor and is involved in regulation of expression of genes encoding ion channels (sodium-gated, ATP-gated and hydrogen ion-gated) and receptors (thermal receptors, opioid receptor MOR and the Mrgpr class of G protein coupled receptors). Mice lacking Runx1 show defective perception of thermal and neuropathic pain (Chen CL et al. 2006). Runx1 is thought to activate the neuronal differentiation of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion cells during embryonal development possibly through repression of Hes1 expression (Kobayashi et al. 2012). In chick and mouse embryos, Runx1 expression is restricted to the dorso-medial domain of the dorsal root ganglion, to TrkA-positive cutaneous sensory neurons. Runx3 expression in chick and mouse embryos is restricted to ventro-lateral domain of the dorsal root ganglion, to TrkC-positive proprioceptive neurons (Chen AI et al. 2006, Kramer et al. 2006).

It is the founding member of a family of IL-6-related cytokines such as IL-11, IL-27 leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cilliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and oncostatin M. <br><br>The IL-6 receptor (IL6R) consists of an alpha subunit that specifically binds IL-6 and a beta subunit, IL6RB or gp130, which is the signaling component of all the receptors for cytokines related to IL-6. IL6R alpha exists in transmembrane and soluble forms. The transmembrane form is mainly expressed by hepatocytes, neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and some lymphocytes. Soluble forms of IL6R (sIL6R) are also expressed by these cells. Two major mechanisms for the production of sIL6R have been proposed. Alternative splicing generates a transcript lacking the transmembrane domain by using splicing donor and acceptor sites that flank the transmembrane domain coding region. This also introduces a frameshift leading to the incorporation of 10 additional amino acids at the C terminus of sIL6R.A second mechanism for the generation of sIL6R is the proteolytic cleavage or 'shedding' of membrane-bound IL-6R. Two proteases ADAM10 and ADAM17 are thought to contribute to this (Briso et al. 2008). sIL6R can bind IL6 and stimulate cells that express gp130 but not IL6R alpha, a process that is termed trans-signaling. This explains why many cells, including hematopoietic progenitor cells, neuronal cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and embryonic stem cells, do not respond to IL6 alone, but show a remarkable response to IL6/sIL6R. It is clear that the trans-signaling pathway is responsible for the pro-inflammatory activities of IL-6 whereas the membrane bound receptor governs regenerative and anti-inflammatory IL-6 activities<br><br>IL6R signal transduction is mediated by two pathways:the JAK-STAT (Janus family tyrosine kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway and the Ras-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway. Negative regulators of IL-6 signaling include SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signals) and SHP2. Within the last few years different antibodies have been developed to inhibit IL-6 activity, and the first such antibodies have been introduced into the clinic for the treatment of inflammatory diseases (Kopf et al. 2010).

These are (1) guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors or GDIs, which maintain Rho proteins in an inactive state in the cytoplasm, (2) guanine nucleotide exchange factors or GEFs, which destabilize the interaction between Rho proteins and their bound nucleotide, the net result of which is the exchange of bound GDP for the more abundant GTP, and (3) GTPase Activating Proteins or GAPs, which stimulate the low intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity of Rho family members, thus promoting their inactivation. GDIs, GEFs, and GAPs are themselves subject to tight regulation, and the overall level of Rho activity reflects the balance of their activities.<p>In their active GTP-bound state, Rho family members have the ability to interact with a large variety of so-called effector proteins.

    9034434: '''Peroxisomes are small cellular organelles that are bounded by a single membrane and contain variable compositions of proteins depending on cell type. Peroxisomes function in oxidation of fatty acids, detoxification of glyoxylate, and synthesis of plasmalogens, glycerophospholipids containing an alcohol with a vinyl-ether bond (reviewed in Lohdi and Semenkovich 2014). All of the approximately 46 proteins contained in peroxisomal matrix are imported from the cytosol by a unique mechanism that does not require the imported proteins to be unfolded as they cross the membrane (Walton et al. 1995, reviewed in Ma et al. 2011, Fujiki et al. 2014, Baker et al. 2016, Dias et al 2016, Emmanoulidis et al. 2016, Erdmann 2016, Francisco et al. 2017). The incompletely characterized process appears to involve the transport of the proteins through a variably sized pore in the membrane comprising at least PEX5 and PEX14 (inferred from the yeast homologs in Meinecke et al. 2010, the yeast pore is reviewed in Meinecke et al. 2016). Oligomeric proteins are also observed to cross the peroxisomal membrane (Otera and Fujiki 2012) but their transport appears to be less efficient than monomeric proteins (Freitas et al. 2011, inferred from mouse homologs in Freitas et al. 2015, reviewed in Dias et al. 2016).<br>In the cytosol, receptor proteins, PEX5 and PEX7, bind to specific sequence motifs in cargo proteins (Dodt et al. 1995, Wiemer et al. 1995, Braverman et al. 1997). The long and short isoforms of PEX5 (PEX5L and PEX5S) bind peroxisome targeting sequence 1 (PTS1, originally identified in firefly luciferase by Gould et al. 1989) found on most peroxisomal matrix proteins; PEX7 binds PTS2 (originally identified in rat 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase by Swinkels et al. 1991) found on 3 imported proteins thus far in humans. The long isoform of PEX5, PEX5L, then binds the PEX7:cargo protein complex (Braverman et al. 1998, Otera et al. 2000). PEX5S,L bound to a cargo protein or PEX5L bound to PEX7:cargo protein then interacts with a complex comprising PEX13, PEX14, PEX2, PEX10, and PEX12 at the peroxisomal membrane (Gould et al. 1996, Fransen et al. 1998, inferred from rat homologs in Reguenga et al. 2001).<br>The ensuing step in which the cargo protein is translocated across the membrane is not completely understood. During translocation, PEX5 and PEX7 become inserted into the membrane (Wiemer et al. 1995, Dodt et al. 1995, Oliveira et al. 2003) and expose a portion of their polypeptide chains to the organellar matrix (Rodrigues et al. 2015). One current model envisages PEX5 as a plunger that inserts into a transmembrane barrel formed by PEX14, PEX13, PEX2, PEX10, and PEX12 (the Docking-Translocation Module) (Francisco et al. 2017).<br>After delivering cargo to the matrix, PEX5 and PEX7 are recycled back to the cytosol by a process requiring mono-ubiquitination of PEX5 and ATP hydrolysis (Imanaka et al. 1987, Thoms and Erdmann 2006, Carvalho et al. 2007). PEX7 is not ubiquitinated but its recycling requires PEX5 mono-ubiquitination. A subcomplex of the Docking-Translocation Module comprising the RING-finger proteins PEX2, PEX10, and PEX12 conjugates a single ubiquitin to a cysteine residue of PEX5 (Carvalho et al. 2007, reviewed in Platta et al. 2016). The mono-ubiquitinated PEX5 and associated PEX7 are then extracted by the exportomer complex consisting of PEX1, PEX6, PEX26, and ZFAND6 (inferred from rat homologs in Miyata et al. 2012). PEX1 and PEX6 are members of the ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities (AAA) family, a group of proteins that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to remodel molecular complexes. PEX1 and PEX6 form a hetero-hexameric ring, best described as a trimer of PEX1/PEX6 dimers (inferred from yeast in Platta et al. 2005, yeast homologs reviewed in Schwerter et al. 2017).

    2022103: '''After removal of the N- and C-procollagen propeptides, fibrillar collagen molecules aggregate into microfibrillar arrays, stabilized by covalent intermolecular cross-links. These depend on the oxidative deamination of specific lysine or hydroxylysine residues in the telopeptide region by lysyl oxidase (LOX) with the subsequent spontaneous formation of covalent intermolecular cross-links (Pinnell & Martin 1968, Siegel et al. 1970, 1974, Maki 2009, Nishioka et al. 2012). Hydroxylysine is formed intracellularly by lysine hydroxylases (LH). There are different forms of LH responsible for hydroxylation of helical and telopeptide lysines (Royce & Barnes 1985, Knott et al.1997, Takaluoma et al. 2007, Myllyla 2007). The chemistry of the cross-links formed depends on whether lysines or hydroxylysines are present in the telopeptides (Barnes et al. 1974), which depends on the proportion of collagen lysines post-translationally converted to hydroxylysine by LH. The lysine pathway predominates in adult skin, cornea and sclera while the hydroxylysine pathway occurs primarily in bone, cartilage, ligament, tendons, embryonic skin and most connective tissues (Eyre 1987, Eyre & Wu 2005, Eyre et al. 2008). Oxidative deamination of lysine or hydroxylysine residues by LOX generates the allysine and hydroxyallysine aldehydes respectively. These can spontaneously react with either another aldehyde to form an aldol condensation product (intramolecular cross-link), or with an unmodified lysine or hydroxylysine residue to form intermolecular cross-links.<br><br>The pathway of cross-linking is regulated primarily by the hydroxylation pattern of telopeptide and triple-helix domain lysine residues. When lysine residues are the source of aldehydes formed by lysyl oxidase the allysine cross-linking pathway leads to the formation of aldimine cross-links (Eyre & Wu 2005). These are stable at physiological conditions but readily cleaved at acid pH or elevated temperature. When hydroxylysine residues are the source of aldehydes formed by lysyl oxidase the hydroxyallysine cross-linking pathway leads to the formation of more stable ketoimine cross-links. <br><br>Telopeptide lysine residues can be converted by LOX to allysine, which can react with a helical hydroxylysine residue forming the lysine aldehyde aldimine cross-link dehydro hydroxylysino norleucine (deHHLNL) (Bailey & Peach 1968, Eyre et al. 2008). If the telopeptide residue is hydroxylysine, the hydroxyallysine formed by LOX can react with a helical hydroxylysine forming the Schiff base, which spontaneously undergoes an Amadori rearrangement resulting in the ketoimine cross link hydroxylysino 5 ketonorleucine (HLKNL). This stable cross-link is formed in tissues where telopeptide residues are predominanly hydroxylated, such as foetal bone and cartilage, accounting for the relative insolubility of collagen from these tissues (Bailey et al. 1998). In bone, telopeptide hydroxyallysines can react with the epsilon-amino group of a helical lysine (Robins & Bailey 1975). The resulting Schiff base undergoes Amadori rearrangement to form lysino-hydroxynorleucine (LHNL). An alternative mechanism of maturation of ketoimine cross-links has been reported in cartilage leading to the formation of arginoline (Eyre et al. 2010). <br><br>These divalent crosslinks greatly diminish as connective tissues mature, due to further spontaneous reactions (Bailey & Shimokomaki 1971, Robins & Bailey 1973) with neighbouring peptides that result in tri- and tetrafunctional cross-links. In mature tissues collagen cross-links are predominantly trivalent. The most common are pyridinoline or 3-hydroxypyridinium cross-links, namely hydroxylysyl-pyridinoline (HL-Pyr) and  lysyl-pyridinoline (L-Pyr) cross-links (Eyre 1987, Ogawa et al. 1982, Fujimoto et al. 1978). HL-Pyr is formed from three hydroxylysine residues, HLKNL plus a further hydroxyallysine. It predominates in highly hydroxylated collagens such as type II collagen in cartilage. L-Pyr is formed from two hydroxylysines and a lysine, LKNL plus a further hydroxyallysine, found mostly in calcified tissues (Bailey et al. 1998). Trivalent collagen cross-links can also form as pyrroles, either Lysyl-Pyrrole (L-Pyrrole) or hydroxylysyl-pyrrole (HL-Pyrrole), respectively formed when LKNL or HLKNL react with allysine (Scott et al. 1981, Kuypers et al. 1992). A further three-way crosslink can form when DeH-HLNL reacts with histidine to form histidino-hydroxylysinonorleucine (HHL), found in skin and cornea (Yamauchi et al. 1987, 1996). This can react with an additional lysine to form the tetrafunctional cross-link histidinohydroxymerodesmosine (Reiser et al. 1992, Yamauchi et al. 1996). <br> <br>Another mechanism which could be involved in the cross-linking of collagen IV networks is the sulfilimine bond (Vanacore et al. 2009), catalyzed by peroxidasin, an enzyme found in basement membrane (Bhave 2012).<br><br>To improve clarity inter-chain cross-linking is represented here for Collagen type I only. Although the formation of each type of cross-link is represented here as an independent event, the partial and random nature of lysine hydroxylation and subsequent lysyl oxidation means that any combination of these cross-linking events could occur within the same collagen fibril .''',

    6814438: '''Small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) play key roles in splicing and some of them, specifically the U1 and U2 snRNAs, are encoded by multicopy snRNA gene clusters containing tandem arrays of genes, about 30 in the RNU1 cluster (Bernstein et al. 1985) and about 10-20 in the RNU2 cluster (Van Ardsell and Weiner 1984). Whereas U6 snRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, U1,U2, U4, U4atac, U5, U11, and U12 genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Transcription of the U1 and U2 genes has been most extensively studied and the other snRNA genes as well as other genes with similar promoter structures, for example the SNORD13 gene, are inferred to be transcribed by similar reactions. The snRNA genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II are distinguished from mRNA-encoding genes by the presence of a proximal sequence element (PSE) rather than a TATA box and the presence of the Integrator complex rather than the Mediator complex (reviewed in Egloff et al. 2008, Jawdeker and Henry 2008).<br>The snRNA genes are among the most rapidly transcribed genes in the genome. The 5' transcribed region of the U2 snRNA gene is largely single-stranded during interphase and metaphase (Pavelitz et al. 2008) and chromatin within the transcribed region is cleared of nucleosomes (O'Reilly et al. 2014). Transcriptional activation of the RNA polymerase II transcribed snRNA genes begins with binding of transcription factors to the distal sequence element (DSE) of the promoter (reviewed in Hernandez 2001, Egloff et al. 2008, Jawdeker and Henry 2008). The factors, which include POU2F1 (Oct-1), POU2F2 (Oct-2), ZNF143 (Staf) and Sp1, promote binding of the SNAPc complex (also known as PTF and PBP) to the PSE. SNAPc helps clear the gene of nucleosomes (O'Reilly et al. 2014) and recruits initiation factors (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and snTAFc:TBP) which recruit RNA polymerase II. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (reviewed in Egloff and Murphy 2008) by CDK7 recruits RPAP2 and the Integrator complex, which is required for later processing of the 3' end of the pre-snRNA transcript (reviewed in Chen and Wagner 2010, Baillat and Wagner 2015). The Little Elongation Complex (LEC) also appears to bind around the time of transcription initiation (Hu et al. 2013). As transcription proceeds, RPAP2 dephosphorylates serine-5 and P-TEFb phosphorylates serine-2 of the CTD. As transcription reaches the end of the snRNA gene serine-7 of the CTD is phosphorylated. These marks serve to bind protein complexes and are required for 3' processing of the pre-snRNA (reviewed in Egloff and Murphy 2008). After transcription proceeds through the conserved 3' processing sequence of the pre-snRNA the Integrator complex cleaves the pre-snRNA. Transcription then terminates downstream in a less well characterized reaction that requires elements of the polyadenylation system.''',

TET proteins can further oxidize 5-hmC to 5-formylcytosine (5-fC) and then 5-carboxylcytosine (5-caC) (He et al. 2011, Ito et al. 2011).

They are highly expressed in spontaneously active cardiac regions, such as the sinoatrial node (SAN, the natural pacemaker region), the atrioventricular node (AVN) and the Purkinje fibres of conduction tissue. HCN channels are encoded by four genes (HCN1, 2, 3, 4) and are widely expressed throughout the heart and the central nervous system. HCN channels are homotetramers of four subunits and conduct a Na+ and K+ current with a permeability of 1:4. The mixed sodium–potassium current activates upon hyperpolarization at voltages in the diastolic range (normally from −60/−70 mV to −40 mV). At the end of a sinoatrial action potential, the membrane repolarizes below −40/−50 mV, the "funny current" is activated and supplies inward current, which is responsible for starting the diastolic depolarization phase (DD); by this mechanism, the funny current controls the rate of spontaneous activity of sinoatrial myocytes, hence the cardiac rate.

Transcription elongation is a rate-limiting step for proper mRNA production in which the phosphorylation of Pol II CTD is a crucial biochemical event.  The role of CTD phosphorylation in transcription by Pol II is greatly impaired by protein kinase inhibitors such as 5,6-dichloro-1- ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), which block CTD phosphorylation and induce arrest of elongating Pol II.

Most BRAF mutations fall in the activation loop region of the kinase or the adjacent glycine rich region. These mutations promote increased kinase activity either by mimicking the effects of activation loop phosphorylations or by promoting the active conformation of the enzyme (Davies et al, 2002; Wan et al, 2004). Roughly 90% of BRAF mutants are represented by the single missense mutation BRAF V600E (Davies et al, 2002; Wan et al, 2004). Other highly active kinase mutants of BRAF include BRAF G469A and BRAF T599dup. G469 is in the glycine rich region of the kinase domain which plays a role in orienting ATP for catalysis, while T599 is one of the two conserved regulatory phosphorylation sites of the activation loop. Each of these mutants has highly enhanced basal kinase activities, phosphorylates MEK and ERK in vitro and in vivo and is transforming when expressed in vivo (Davies et al, 2002; Wan et al, 2004; Eisenhardt et al, 2011). Further functional characterization shows that these highly active mutants are largely resistant to disruption of the BRAF dimer interface, suggesting that they are able to act as monomers (Roring et al, 2012; Brummer et al, 2006; Freeman et al, 2013; Garnett et al, 2005). Activating BRAF mutations occur for the most part independently of RAS activating mutations, and RAS activity levels are generally low in BRAF mutant cells. Moreover, the kinase activity of these mutants is only slightly elevated by coexpression of G12V KRAS, and biological activity of the highly active BRAF mutants is independent of RAS binding (Brummer et al, 2006; Wan et al, 2004; Davies et al, 2002; Garnett et al, 2005). Although BRAF V600E is inhibited by RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib, resistance frequently develops, in some cases mediated by the expression of a splice variant that lacks the RAS binding domain and shows elevated dimerization compared to the full length V600E mutant (Poulikakos et al, 2011; reviewed in Lito et al, 2013).''',
    166668: '''Activation of the lectin pathway (LP) is initiated by Mannose-binding lectin (MBL), the hetero-complex CL-LK formed from COLEC11 (Collectin liver 1, CL-L1) and COLEC10 (Collectin kidney 1, CL-K1), and the ficolins (FCN1, FCN2, FCN3). All are Ca-dependent (C-type) lectins that initiate the complement cascade after binding to specific carbohydrate patterns on the target cell surface. All form trimers and larger oligomers (Jensen et al. 2005, Dommett et al. 2006, Garlatti et al. 2010). MBL and ficolins circulate in plasma as complexes with homodimers of MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP) (Fujita et al. 2004, Hajela et al. 2002). MASP1, MASP2 and MASP3 have all been reported to mediate complement activation. Upon binding of human lectin to the target surface, the complex of lectin:MASP undergoes conformational changes that result in MASP cleavage and activation (Matsushita M et al. 2000, Fujita et al. 2004). Active MASP2 cleaves C4 to generate C4a and C4b. C4b binds to the target cell surface via its thioester bond, then binds circulating C2 (Law and Dodds 1997). Bound C2 is cleaved by MASP2 to yield the C3 convertase C4b:C2a. The active form of MASP1 was reported to cleave C2 in a manner similar to MASP2 (Matsushita et al. 2000, Chen & Wallis 2004). MASP1 can cleave proenzyme MASP2, leading to complement activation (Heja et al. 2012). MASP1 can also cleave fibrinogen to yield fibrinopeptide B, and activates factor XIII. MASP1 may have a role in removal of 'dead C3', i.e. C3(H2O) (Hajela et al. 2002). In addition to MASP1 to 3, two alternatively-slpiced forms of MASP1 (MAp44) and MASP2 (sMAP) have been implicated in complement cascade signaling (Takahashi et al. 1999, Degn et al. 2010). The functions of MASP3, sMAP and MAp44 in the lectin pathway remain to be clarified.''',

It is considered to be a Pattern Recognition Receptor (Liliensiek et al. 2004). It recognizes a large variety of modified proteins known as advanced glycation/glycosylation endproducts (AGEs), a heterogenous group of structures that are generated by the Maillard reaction, a consequence of long-term incubation of proteins with glucose (Ikeda et al. 1996). Their accumulation is associated with diabetes, atherosclerosis, renal failure and ageing (Schmidt et al. 1999). The most prevalent class of AGE in vivo are N(6)-carboxymethyllysine (NECML) adducts (Kislinger et al. 1991). In addition to AGEs, AGER is a signal transduction receptor for amyloid-beta peptide (Ab) (Yan et al. 1996), mediating Ab neurotoxicity and promoting Ab influx into the brain. AGER also responds to the proinflammatory S100/calgranulins (Hofmann et al. 1999) and High mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1/Amphoterin/DEF), a protein linked to neurite outgrowth and cellular motility (Hori et al. 1995).<br><br>The major inflammatory pathway stimulated by AGER activation is NFkappaB. Though the signaling cascade is unclear, several pieces of experimental data suggest that activation of AGER leads to sustained activation and upregulation of NFkappaB, measured as NFkappaB translocation to the nucleus, and increased levels of de novo synthesized NFkappaB (Bierhaus et al. 2001). As this is clearly an indirect effect it is represented here as positive regulation of NFkappaB translocation to the nucleus. AGER can bind ERK1/2 and thereby activate the MAPK and JNK cascades (Bierhaus et al. 2005).''',

Loss of the bioavailability of endothelium derived NO is a key feature of endothelial dysfunction and is implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease such as hypertension and atherosclerosis.  The endothelial isoform eNOS is unique among the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) family in that it is co-translationally modified at its amino terminus by myristoylation and is further acylated by palmitoylation (two residues next to the myristoylation site).

Cbl consists of a planar corrin ring coordinating with a cobalt atom through four nitrogen atoms. A 5,6-dimethylbenzamidizole base coordinates with the cobalt atom in the lower axial position while a number of different species can coordinate with the cobalt atom in the upper axial position. It is the cobalt-corrin ring complex that gives all Cbls a deep red colour.

In mammalian cells, Cbl or CNCbl is converted to two active coenzyme derivatives; methylcobalamin (MetCbl) and adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl). MetCbl is required for activity of the cytoplasmic enzyme methionine synthase, which converts homocysteine to methionine. AdoCbl is required for activity of the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl CoA mutase, which converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA (Seetharam 1999).

    6806325: '''Phosphorylation of TP53 (p53) at the N-terminal serine residues S15 and S20 plays a critical role in protein stabilization as phosphorylation at these sites interferes with binding of the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 to TP53. Several different kinases can phosphorylate TP53 at S15 and S20. In response to double strand DNA breaks, S15 is phosphorylated by ATM (Banin et al. 1998, Canman et al. 1998, Khanna et al. 1998), and S20 by CHEK2 (Chehab et al. 1999, Chehab et al. 2000, Hirao et al. 2000). DNA damage or other types of genotoxic stress, such as stalled replication forks, can trigger ATR-mediated phosphorylation of TP53 at S15 (Lakin et al. 1999, Tibbetts et al. 1999) and CHEK1-mediated phosphorylation of TP53 at S20 (Shieh et al. 2000). In response to various types of cell stress, NUAK1 (Hou et al. 2011), CDK5 (Zhang et al. 2002, Lee et al. 2007, Lee et al. 2008), AMPK (Jones et al. 2005) and TP53RK (Abe et al. 2001, Facchin et al. 2003) can phosphorylate TP53 at S15, while PLK3 (Xie, Wang et al. 2001, Xie, Wu et al. 2001) can phosphorylate TP53 at S20.<p>Phosphorylation of TP53 at serine residue S46 promotes transcription of TP53-regulated apoptotic genes rather than cell cycle arrest genes. Several kinases can phosphorylate S46 of TP53, including ATM-activated DYRK2, which, like TP53, is targeted for degradation by MDM2 (Taira et al. 2007, Taira et al. 2010). TP53 is also phosphorylated at S46 by HIPK2 in the presence of the TP53 transcriptional target TP53INP1 (D'Orazi et al. 2002, Hofmann et al. 2002, Tomasini et al. 2003). CDK5, in addition to phosphorylating TP53 at S15, also phosphorylates it at S33 and S46, which promotes neuronal cell death (Lee et al. 2007).<p>MAPKAPK5 (PRAK) phosphorylates TP53 at serine residue S37, promoting cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence in response to oncogenic RAS signaling (Sun et al. 2007).<p>NUAK1 phosphorylates TP53 at S15 and S392, and phosphorylation at S392 may contribute to TP53-mediated transcriptional activation of cell cycle arrest genes (Hou et al. 2011).

S315 of TP53 is phosphorylated by Aurora kinase A (AURKA) (Katayama et al. 2004) and CDK2 (Luciani et al. 2000). Interaction with MDM2 and the consequent TP53 degradation is also increased by phosphorylation of TP53 threonine residue T55 by the transcription initiation factor complex TFIID (Li et al. 2004).<p>Aurora kinase B (AURKB) has been shown to phosphorylate TP53 at serine residue S269 and threonine residue T284, which is possibly facilitated by the binding of the NIR co-repressor. AURKB-mediated phosphorylation was reported to inhibit TP53 transcriptional activity through an unknown mechanism (Wu et al. 2011). A putative direct interaction between TP53 and AURKB has also been described and linked to TP53 phosphorylation and S183, T211 and S215 and TP53 degradation (Gully et al. 2012).''',

    6806332: '''Association of TP53 (p53) with various transcriptional co-factors can promote, inhibit or provide specificity towards either transcription of cell cycle arrest genes or transcription of cell death genes. Binding of the zinc finger protein ZNF385A (HZF), which is a transcriptional target of TP53, stimulates transcription of cell cycle arrest genes, such as CDKN1A (Das et al. 2007). Binding of POU4F1 (BRN3A) to TP53 also stimulates transcription of cell cycle arrest genes while inhibiting transcription of pro-apoptotic genes (Budhram-Mahadeo et al. 1999, Hudson et al. 2005).<p>Binding of ASPP family proteins PPP1R13B (ASPP1) or TP53BP2 (ASPP2) to TP53 stimulates transcription of pro-apoptotic TP53 targets (Samuels-Lev et al. 2001, Bergamaschi et al. 2004). Binding of the ASPP family member PPP1R13L (iASSP) inhibits TP53-mediated activation of pro-apoptotic genes probably by interfering with binding of stimulatory ASPPs to TP53 (Bergamaschi et al. 2003). Transcription of pro-apoptotic genes is also stimulated by binding of TP53 to POU4F2 (BRN3B) (Budrham-Mahadeo et al. 2006, Budhram-Mahadeo et al. 2014) or to hCAS/CSE1L (Tanaka et al. 2007).<p>Binding of co-factors to TP53 can also affect protein stability. For example, PHF20 binds to TP53 dimethylated on lysine residues K370 and K382 by unidentified protein lysine methyltransferase(s) and interferes with MDM2 binding, resulting in prolonged TP53 half-life (Cui et al. 2012). Long noncoding RNAs can contribute to p53-dependent transcriptional responses (Huarte et al. 2010).

    5684031: '''The alveolar region of the lung creates an extensive epithelial surface that mediates the transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide required for respiration after birth. Type I epithelial cells form the alveolar surface and mediate gaseous exchange. Type II epithelial cells secrete pulmonary surfactant, a lipoprotein complex that forms a thin interfacial film, lowering surface tension at the air-liquid interface in alveoli and maintaining the structural integrity of alveoli, preventing their collapse at low volumes (Agassandian & Mallampalli 2013). Surfactant production is increased prior to birth, in preparation for air breathing at birth (Hallman 2013). Pre-term infants, where type II epithelial cells are not fully differentiated yet, can produce insufficient surfactant and result in respiratory distress syndrome. Surfactant is composed primarily of phospholipids enriched in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (Agassandian & Mallampalli 2013) and the pulmonary collectins, termed surfactant proteins A, B, C and D (SFTPA-D). They influence surfactant homeostasis, contributing to the physical structures of lipids in the alveoli and to the regulation of surfactant function and metabolism. They are directly secreted from alveolar type II cells into the airway to function as part of the surfactant. SFTPA and D are large, hydrophilic proteins while SFTPB and C are small, very hydrophobic proteins (Johansson et al. 1994). In addition to their surfactant functions, SFTPA and D play important roles in innate host defense by binding and clearing invading microbes from the lung (Kingma & Whitsett 2006). Nuclear regulation, transport, metabolism, reutilisation and degradation of surfactant are described here (Ikegami 2006, Boggaram 2009, Whitsett et al. 2010). Mutations in genes involved in these processes can result in respiratory distress syndrome, lung proteinosis, interstitial lung diseases and chronic lung diseases (Perez-Gil & Weaver 2010, Whitsett et al. 2010, Akella & Deshpande 2013, Jo 2014).''',
    6785855: '''Interleukin-4 (IL4) is a principal regulatory cytokine during the immune response, crucially important in allergy and asthma (Nelms et al. 1999). When resting T cells are antigen-activated and expand in response to Interleukin-2 (IL2), they can differentiate as Type 1 (Th1) or Type 2 (Th2) T helper cells. The outcome is influenced by IL4. Th2 cells secrete IL4, which both stimulates Th2 in an autocrine fashion and acts as a potent B cell growth factor to promote humoral immunity (Nelms et al. 1999). <br><br>Interleukin-13 (IL13) is an immunoregulatory cytokine secreted predominantly by activated Th2 cells. It is a key mediator in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation. IL13 shares many functional properties with IL4, stemming from the fact that they share a common receptor subunit. IL13 receptors are expressed on human B cells, basophils, eosinophils, mast cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, monocytes, macrophages, respiratory epithelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, but unlike IL4, not T cells. Thus IL13 does not appear to be important in the initial differentiation of CD4 T cells into Th2 cells, rather it is important in the effector phase of allergic inflammation (Hershey et al. 2003).

IL4 and IL13 induce “alternative activation” of macrophages, inducing an anti-inflammatory phenotype by signaling through IL4R alpha in a STAT6 dependent manner. This signaling plays an important role in the Th2 response, mediating anti-parasitic effects and aiding wound healing (Gordon & Martinez 2010, Loke et al. 2002)

There are two types of IL4 receptor complex (Andrews et al. 2006). Type I IL4R (IL4R1) is predominantly expressed on the surface of hematopoietic cells and consists of IL4R and IL2RG, the common gamma chain. Type II IL4R (IL4R2) is predominantly expressed on the surface of nonhematopoietic cells, it consists of IL4R and IL13RA1 and is also the type II receptor for IL13. (Obiri et al. 1995, Aman et al. 1996, Hilton et al. 1996, Miloux et al. 1997, Zhang et al. 1997). The second receptor for IL13 consists of IL4R and Interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13RA2), sometimes called Interleukin-13 binding protein (IL13BP). It has a high affinity receptor for IL13 (Kd = 250 pmol/L) but is not sufficient to render cells responsive to IL13, even in the presence of IL4R (Donaldson et al. 1998). It is reported to exist in soluble form (Zhang et al. 1997) and when overexpressed reduces JAK-STAT signaling (Kawakami et al. 2001). It's function may be to prevent IL13 signalling via the functional IL4R:IL13RA1 receptor. IL13RA2 is overexpressed and enhances cell invasion in some human cancers (Joshi & Puri 2012).<br><br>The first step in the formation of IL4R1 (IL4:IL4R:IL2RB) is the binding of IL4 with IL4R (Hoffman et al. 1995, Shen et al. 1996, Hage et al. 1999). This is also the first step in formation of IL4R2 (IL4:IL4R:IL13RA1). After the initial binding of IL4 and IL4R, IL2RB binds (LaPorte et al. 2008), to form IL4R1. Alternatively, IL13RA1 binds, forming IL4R2. In contrast, the type II IL13 complex (IL13R2) forms with IL13 first binding to IL13RA1 followed by recruitment of  IL4R (Wang et al. 2009).<br><br>Crystal structures of the IL4:IL4R:IL2RG, IL4:IL4R:IL13RA1 and IL13:IL4R:IL13RA1 complexes have been determined (LaPorte et al. 2008). Consistent with these structures, in monocytes IL4R is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to both IL4 and IL13 (Roy et al. 2002, Gordon & Martinez 2010) while IL13RA1 phosphorylation is induced only by IL13 (Roy et al. 2002, LaPorte et al. 2008) and IL2RG phosphorylation is induced only by IL4 (Roy et al. 2002).<br><br>Both IL4 receptor complexes signal through Jak/STAT cascades. IL4R is constitutively-associated with JAK2 (Roy et al. 2002) and associates with JAK1 following binding of IL4 (Yin et al. 1994) or IL13 (Roy et al. 2002). IL2RG constitutively associates with JAK3 (Boussiotis et al. 1994, Russell  et al. 1994). IL13RA1 constitutively associates with TYK2 (Umeshita-Suyama et al. 2000, Roy et al. 2002, LaPorte et al. 2008, Bhattacharjee et al. 2013). <br><br>IL4 binding to IL4R1 leads to phosphorylation of JAK1 (but not JAK2) and STAT6 activation (Takeda et al. 1994, Ratthe et al. 2007, Bhattacharjee et al. 2013). <br><br>IL13 binding increases activating tyrosine-99 phosphorylation of IL13RA1 but not that of IL2RG. IL4 binding to IL2RG leads to its tyrosine phosphorylation (Roy et al. 2002). IL13 binding to IL4R2 leads to TYK2 and JAK2 (but not JAK1) phosphorylation (Roy & Cathcart 1998, Roy et al. 2002).<br><br>Phosphorylated TYK2 binds and phosphorylates STAT6 and possibly STAT1 (Bhattacharjee et al. 2013).  <br><br>A second mechanism of signal transduction activated by IL4 and IL13 leads to the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) family (Kelly-Welch et al. 2003). IL4R1 associates with insulin receptor substrate 2 and activates the PI3K/Akt and Ras/MEK/Erk pathways involved in cell proliferation, survival and translational control. IL4R2 does not associate with insulin receptor substrate 2 and consequently the PI3K/Akt and Ras/MEK/Erk pathways are not activated (Busch-Dienstfertig & González-Rodríguez 2013).''',
    994113: '''In the latter compartments of the distal Golgi the N-Glycan is further modified, leading to the wide range of N-Glycans observed in multicellular organisms. The first step of N-Glycan elongation in the Golgi is the addition of a GlcNAc residue on the alpha 1,3 branch by the enzyme MGAT1 (GlcNAc-TI), which commits the elongation pathway to Complex or Hybrid N-Glycans from Oligomannose N-Glycans. At this point, the pathway bifurcates again to generate Complex or Hybrid N-Glycans. The addition of a GlcNAc in the middle of the two arms of the N-Glycan, catalyzed by MGAT3 (GNT-III), inhibits the removal of the mannoses on the alpha1,3 branches by MAN2 and the addition of a GlcNAc by MGAT2 (GlcNAc-TII), and commits the pathway toward the synthesis of hybrid N-Glycans. Alternatively, the removal of these mannoses and the action of MGAT2 leads to the synthesis of complex N-Glycans (Kornfeld and Kornfeld 1985).<br>The exact structure of the network of reactions leading to Complex or Hybrid N-Glycans is still not completely described and validated experimentally.

    8952643: '''NEDD8 is a small ubiquitin-like molecule that is conjugated to substrate proteins through an E1 to E3 enzyme cascade similar to that for ubiquitin. The best characterized target of neddylation is the cullin scaffold subunit of cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), which themselves target numerous cellular proteins for degradation by the proteasome (Hori et al, 1999; reviewed in Soucy et al, 2010; Lyedeard et al, 2013). The multisubunit CRL complexes are compositionally diverse, but each contains a scaffolding cullin protein (CUL1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, 5, 7 or 9) and a RING box-containing E3 ligase subunit RBX, along with other adaptor and substrate-interacting subunits. RBX2 (also known as RNF7) interacts preferentially with CUL5, while RBX1 is the primary E3 for most other cullin family members (reviewed in Mahon et al, 2014). Neddylation of the cullin subunit increases the ubiquitination activity of the CRL complex (Podust et al, 2000; Read et al, 2000; Wu et al, 2000; Kawakami et al, 2001; Ohh et al, 2002; Yu et al, 2015). In addition to CRL complexes, a number of other less-well characterized NEDD8 targets have been identified. These include other E3 ubiquitin ligases such as SMURF1 and MDM2, receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR and TGF beta RII, and proteins that contribute to transcriptional regulation, among others (Xie et al, 2014; Watson et al, 2010; Oved et al, 2006; Zuo et al, 2013; Xirodimas et al, 2004; Singh et al, 2007; Abida et al, 2007; Liu et al 2010; Watson et al, 2006; Loftus et al, 2012; Aoki et al, 2013; reviewed in Enchev et al, 2015). <br>Like ubiquitin, NEDD8 undergoes post-translational processing to generate the mature form. UCHL3- or SENP8-mediated proteolysis removes the C-terminal 5 amino acids of NEDD8, generating a novel C-terminal glycine residue for conjugation to the cysteine residues in the E1, E2 enzymes or lysine residues in the substrate protein, usually the E3 NEDD8 ligase itself (Wada et al, 1998; reviewed in Enchev et al, 2015). Most substrates in vivo appear to be singly neddylated on one or more lysine residues, but NEDD8 chains have been formed on cullin substrates in vitro and on histone H4 in cultured human cells after DNA damage (Jones et al, 2008; Ohki et al, 2009; Xirodimas et al, 2008; Jeram et al, 2010; Ma et al, 2013; reviewed in Enchev et al, 2015). The significance of NEDD8 chains is still not clear. <br>NEDD8 has a single heterodimeric E1 enzyme, consisting of NAE1 (also known as APPBP1) and UBA3, and two E2 enzymes, UBE2M and UBE2F, which are N-terminally acetylated (Walden et al, 2003; Bohnsack et al, 2003; Huang et al, 2004; Huang et al, 2005; Huang et al, 2009; Scott et al, 2011a; Monda et al, 2013; reviewed in Enchev et al, 2015). All NEDD8 E3 enzymes reported to date also function as E3 ubiquitin ligases, and most belong to the RING domain class. The best characterized NEDD8 E3 enzymes are the CRL complexes described above. RBX1-containing complexes interact preferentially with UBE2M, while UBE2F is the E2 for RBX2-containing complexes (Huang et al, 2009; Monda et al, 2013). <br>Neddylation is regulated in vivo by interaction with DCUN1D proteins (also called DCNLs). The 5 human DCUN1D proteins interact both with cullins and with the NEDD8 E2 proteins and thereby increase the kinetic efficiency of neddylation (Kurz et al, 2005; Kurz et al, 2008; Scott et al, 2010; Scott et al, 2011a; Scott et al, 2014; Monda et al, 2013). Glomulin (GLMN) is another regulator of CRL function that binds to the neddylated cullin and competitively inhibits interaction with the ubiquitin E2 enzyme (Arai et al, 2003; Tron et al, 2012; Duda et al, 2012; reviewed in Mahon et al, 2014).<br>The multisubunit COP9 signalosome is the only cullin deneddylase, while SENP8 (also known as DEN1) contributes to deneddylation of other non-cullin NEDD8 targets (Cope et al, 2002; Emberley et al, 2012; Chan et al, 2008; Wu et al, 2003; reviewed in Wei et al, 2008; Enchev et al, 2015). In the deneddylated state, cullins bind to CAND1 (cullin associated NEDD8-dissociated protein1), which displaces the COP9 signalosome and promotes the exchange of the ubiquitin substrate-specific adaptor. This allows CRL complexes to be reconfigured to target other subtrates for ubiquitination (Liu et al, 2002; Schmidt et al, 2009; Pierce et al, 2013; reviewed in Mahon et al, 2014).<br><br>''',

    6806341: '''Transcriptional activity of TP53 is positively regulated by acetylation of several of its lysine residues. BRD7 binds TP53 and promotes acetylation of TP53 lysine residue K382 by acetyltransferase EP300 (p300). Acetylation of K382 enhances TP53 binding to target promoters, including CDKN1A (p21), MDM2, SERPINE1, TIGAR, TNFRSF10C and NDRG1 (Bensaad et al. 2010, Burrows et al. 2010. Drost et al. 2010). The histone acetyltransferase KAT6A, in the presence of PML, also acetylates TP53 at K382, and, in addition, acetylates K120 of TP53. KAT6A-mediated acetylation increases transcriptional activation of CDKN1A by TP53 (Rokudai et al. 2013). Acetylation of K382 can be reversed by the action of the NuRD complex, containing the TP53-binding MTA2 subunit, resulting in inhibition of TP53 transcriptional activity (Luo et al. 2000). Acetylation of lysine K120 in the DNA binding domain of TP53 by the MYST family acetyltransferases KAT8 (hMOF) and KAT5 (TIP60) can modulate the decision between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Sykes et al. 2006, Tang et al. 2006). Studies with acetylation-defective knock-in mutant mice indicate that lysine acetylation in the p53 DNA binding domain acts in part by uncoupling transactivation and transrepression of gene targets, while retaining ability to modulate energy metabolism and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and influencing ferroptosis (Li et al. 2012, Jiang et al. 2015).''',

    6802247: '''While BRAF-specific inhibitors inhibit MAPK/ERK activation in the presence of the BRAF V600E mutant, paradoxical activation of ERK signaling has been observed after treatment of cells with inhibitor in the presence of WT BRAF (Wan et al, 2004; Garnett et al, 2005; Heidorn et al, 2010; Hazivassiliou et al, 2010; Poulikakos et al, 2010). This paradoxical ERK activation is also seen in cells expressing kinase-dead or impaired versions of BRAF such as D594V, which occur with low frequency in some cancers (Wan et al, 2004; Heidorn et al, 2010).  Unlike BRAF V600E, which occurs exclusively of activating RAS mutations, kinase-impaired versions of BRAF are coincident with RAS mutations in human cancers, and indeed, paradoxical activation of ERK signaling in the presence of inactive BRAF is enhanced in the presence of oncogenic RAS (Heidorn et al, 2010; reviewed in Holderfield et al, 2014).  Although the details remain to be worked out, paradoxical ERK activation in the presence of inactive BRAF appears to rely on enhanced dimerization with and transactivation of CRAF (Heidorn et al, 2010; Hazivassiliou et al, 2010; Poulikakos et al, 2010;  Roring et al, 2012; Rajakulendran et al, 2009; Holderfield et al, 2013; Freeman et al, 2013; reviewed in Roskoski, 2010; Samatar and Poulikakos, 2014; Lavoie and Therrien, 2015).''',

Binding is stimulated by fructose 6-phosphate and sorbitol 6-phosphate (hence high concentrations of these molecules tend to reduce GCK1 activity) and inhibited by fructose 1-phosphate (hence a high concentration of this molecule tends to increase GCK1 activity). Once formed, the complex is translocated to the nucleus. In the presence of high glucose concentrations, the nuclear GCK1:GKRP complex dissociates, freeing GCK1 to return to the cytosol. The free GKRP is thought also to return to the cytosol under these conditions, but this return has not been confirmed experimentally. Possible physiological roles for this sequestration process are to decrease futile cycling between glucose and glucose 6 phosphate in hepatocytes under low-glucose conditions, and to decrease the lag between a rise in intracellular glucose levels and the onset of glucose phosphorylation in both hepatocytes and pancreatic beta cells (Brocklehurst et al. 2004; Shiota et al. 1999).''',

    379723: '''tRNA synthetases catalyze the ligation of tRNAs to their cognate amino acids in an ATP-dependent manner. The reaction proceeds in two steps. First, amino acid and ATP form an aminoacyl adenylate molecule, releasing pyrophosphate. The aminoacyl adenylate remains associated with the synthetase enzyme where, in the second step it reacts with tRNA to form aminoacyl tRNA and AMP. The rapid hydrolysis of pyrophosphate makes these reactions essentially irreversible under physiological conditions (Fersht and Kaethner 1976a). Specificity of the tRNA charging reactions is achieved both by specific recognition of amino acid and tRNA substrates by the synthetase, and by an editing process in which incorrect aminoacyl adenylate molecules (e.g., valyl adenylate associated with isoleucyl tRNA synthetase) are hydrolyzed rather than conjugated to tRNAs in the second step of the reaction (Baldwin and Berg 1966a,b; Fersht and Kaethner 1976b). The tRNA synthetases can be divided into two structural classes based on conserved amino acid sequence features (Burnbaum and Schimmel 1991).<p>A single synthetase mediates the charging of all of the tRNA species specific for any one amino acid but, with three exceptions, glycine, lysine, and glutamine, the synthetase that catalyzes aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNAs is encoded by a different gene than the one that acts on mitochondrial tRNAs.

    203614: '''Nitric oxide (NO), a multifunctional second messenger, is implicated in physiological functions in mammals that range from immune response and potentiation of synaptic transmission to dilation of blood vessels and muscle relaxation. NO is a highly active molecule that diffuses across cell membranes and cannot be stored inside the producing cell. Its signaling capacity must be controlled at the levels of biosynthesis and local availability. Indeed, NO production by NO synthases is under complex and tight control, being regulated at transcriptional and translational levels, through co- and posttranslational modifications, and by subcellular localization. NO is synthesized from L-arginine by a family of nitric oxide synthases (NOS).  Three NOS isoforms have been characterized: neuronal NOS (nNOS, NOS1) primarily found in neuronal tissue and skeletal muscle; inducible NOS (iNOS, NOS2) originally isolated from macrophages and later discovered in many other cells types; and endothelial NOS (eNOS, NOS3) present in vascular endothelial cells, cardiac myocytes, and in blood platelets. The enzymatic activity of all three isoforms is dependent on calmodulin, which binds to nNOS and eNOS at elevated intracellular calcium levels, while it is tightly associated with iNOS even at basal calcium levels. As a result, the enzymatic activity of nNOS and eNOS is modulated by changes in intracellular calcium levels, leading to transient NO production, while iNOS continuously releases NO independent of fluctuations in intracellular calcium levels and is mainly regulated at the gene expression level (Pacher et al. 2007).<p>The NOS enzymes share a common basic structural organization and requirement for substrate cofactors for enzymatic activity. A central calmodulin-binding motif separates an oxygenase (NH2-terminal) domain from a reductase (COOH-terminal) domain. Binding sites for cofactors NADPH, FAD, and FMN are located within the reductase domain, while binding sites for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and heme are located within the oxygenase domain. Once calmodulin binds, it facilitates electron transfer from the cofactors in the reductase domain to heme enabling nitric oxide production. Both nNOS and eNOS contain an additional insert (40-50 amino acids) in the middle of the FMN-binding subdomain that serves as autoinhibitory loop, destabilizing calmodulin binding at low calcium levels and inhibiting electron transfer from FMN to the heme in the absence of calmodulin.  iNOS does not contain this insert.<p>Because NOS enzymatic activity is modulated by the presence of its substrates and cofactors within the cell, under certain conditions, NOS may generate superoxide instead of NO, a process referred to as uncoupling (uncoupling of NADPH oxidation and NO synthesis).<p>The molecular details of eNOS function are annotated here.''',

In addition, glycerophospholipids act as precursors of lipid mediators such as platelet-activating factor and eicosanoids.  Cellular membranes contains a distinct composition of various glycerophospholipids such as phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), cardiolipin (CL), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and lysobisphosphatidic acid (also known as bis(monoacylglycerol) hydrogen phosphate - BMP).<br><br>Glycerophospholipids are first formed by the <i>de novo</i> (Kennedy) pathway using fatty acids activated as acyl-CoA donors.  However, the acyl groups of glycerophospholipids are highly diverse and distributed in an asymmetric manner.  Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids are usually esterified at the <i>sn-1</i> position, whereas polyunsaturated acyl groups are esterified at the <i>sn-2</i> position.

Next, LPA is converted to PA by a LPA acyltransferase (AGPAT, also known as LPAAT), then PA is metabolized into two types of glycerol derivatives.  The first is diacylglycerol (DAG) which is converted to triacylglycerol (TAG), PC, and PE.  Subsequently, PS is synthesized from PC or PE.  The second is cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG), which is processed into PI, PG, CL, and BMP.

Prolonged exposure to interferon-beta (IFNB, IFN-beta) also results in ROS increase (Moiseeva et al. 2006). ROS oxidize thioredoxin (TXN), which causes TXN to dissociate from the N-terminus of MAP3K5 (ASK1), enabling MAP3K5 to become catalytically active (Saitoh et al. 1998). ROS also stimulate expression of Ste20 family kinases MINK1 (MINK) and TNIK through an unknown mechanism, and MINK1 and TNIK positively regulate MAP3K5 activation (Nicke et al. 2005).<p> <br>MAP3K5 phosphorylates and activates MAP2K3 (MKK3) and MAP2K6 (MKK6) (Ichijo et al. 1997, Takekawa et al. 2005), which act as p38 MAPK kinases, as well as MAP2K4 (SEK1) (Ichijo et al. 1997, Matsuura et al. 2002), which, together with MAP2K7 (MKK7), acts as a JNK kinase.<p> <br>MKK3 and MKK6 phosphorylate and activate p38 MAPK alpha (MAPK14) and beta (MAPK11) (Raingeaud et al. 1996), enabling p38 MAPKs to phosphorylate and activate MAPKAPK2 (MK2) and MAPKAPK3 (MK3) (Ben-Levy et al. 1995, Clifton et al. 1996, McLaughlin et al. 1996, Sithanandam et al. 1996, Meng et al. 2002, Lukas et al. 2004, White et al. 2007), as well as MAPKAPK5 (PRAK) (New et al. 1998 and 2003, Sun et al. 2007).<p> <br>Phosphorylation of JNKs (MAPK8, MAPK9 and MAPK10) by MAP3K5-activated MAP2K4 (Deacon and Blank 1997, Fleming et al. 2000) allows JNKs to migrate to the nucleus (Mizukami et al. 1997) where they phosphorylate JUN. Phosphorylated JUN binds FOS phosphorylated by ERK1 or ERK2, downstream of activated RAS (Okazaki and Sagata 1995, Murphy et al. 2002), forming the activated protein 1 (AP-1) complex (FOS:JUN heterodimer) (Glover and Harrison 1995, Ainbinder et al. 1997). <p> <br>Activation of p38 MAPKs and JNKs downstream of MAP3K5 (ASK1) ultimately converges on transcriptional regulation of CDKN2A locus. In dividing cells, nucleosomes bound to the CDKN2A locus are trimethylated on lysine residue 28 of histone H3 (HIST1H3A) by the Polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2), creating the H3K27Me3 (Me3K-28-HIST1H3A) mark (Bracken et al. 2007, Kotake et al. 2007). The expression of Polycomb constituents of PRC2 (Kuzmichev et al. 2002) - EZH2, EED and SUZ12 - and thereby formation of the PRC2, is positively regulated in growing cells by E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3 (Weinmann et al. 2001, Bracken et al. 2003). H3K27Me3 mark serves as a docking site for the Polycomb repressor complex 1 (PRC1) that contains BMI1 (PCGF4) and is therefore named PRC1.4, leading to the repression of transcription of p16-INK4A and p14-ARF from the CDKN2A locus, where PCR1.4 mediated repression of p14-ARF transcription in humans may be context dependent (Voncken et al. 2005, Dietrich et al. 2007, Agherbi et al. 2009, Gao et al. 2012). MAPKAPK2 and MAPKAPK3, activated downstream of the MAP3K5-p38 MAPK cascade, phosphorylate BMI1 of the PRC1.4 complex, leading to dissociation of PRC1.4 complex from the CDKN2A locus and upregulation of p14-ARF transcription (Voncken et al. 2005). AP-1 transcription factor, formed as a result of MAP3K5-JNK signaling, as well as RAS signaling, binds the promoter of KDM6B (JMJD3) gene and stimulates KDM6B expression. KDM6B is a histone demethylase that removes H3K27Me3 mark i.e. demethylates lysine K28 of HIST1H3A, thereby preventing PRC1.4 binding to the CDKN2A locus and allowing transcription of p16-INK4A (Agger et al. 2009, Barradas et al. 2009, Lin et al. 2012).<p> <br>p16-INK4A inhibits phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of RB family members by CDK4 and CDK6, leading to cell cycle arrest (Serrano et al. 1993). p14-ARF inhibits MDM2-mediated degradation of TP53 (p53) (Zhang et al. 1998), which also contributes to cell cycle arrest in cells undergoing oxidative stress.

    5655426: '''mTORC1 integrates four major signals – growth factors, energy status, oxygen and amino acids – to regulate many processes that are involved in the promotion of cell growth. Growth factors stimulate mTORC1 through the activation of the canonical insulin and Ras signaling pathways. The energy status of the cell is signaled to mTORC1 through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key sensor of intracellular energy status (Hardie 2007). Energy depletion (low ATP:ADP ratio) activates AMPK which phosphorylates TSC2, increasing its GAP activity towards Rheb which reduces mTORC1 activation (Inoki et al. 2003). AMPK can reduce mTORC1 activity by directly phosphorylating Raptor (Gwinn et al. 2008). Amino acids positively regulate mTORC1 (reviewed by Guertin & Sabatini 2007). In the presence of amino acids, Rag proteins bind Raptor to promote the relocalization of mTORC1 from the cytoplasm to lysosomal membranes (Puertollano 2014) where it is activated by Rheb (Saucedo et al. 2003, Stocker et al. 2003). Translocation of mTOR to the lysosome requires active Rag GTPases and a complex known as Ragulator, a pentameric protein complex that anchors the Rag GTPases to lysosomes (Sancak et al. 2008, 2010, Bar-Peled et al. 2012). Rag proteins function as heterodimers, consisting of GTP-bound RagA or RagB complexed with GDP-bound RagC or RagD. Amino acids may trigger the GTP loading of RagA/B, thereby promoting binding to raptor and assembly of an activated mTORC1 complex, though a recent study suggested that the activation of mTORC1 is not dependent on Rag GTP charging (Oshiro et al. 2014). 

The activity of Rheb is regulated by a complex consisting of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1), TSC2, and TBC1 domain family member 7 (TBC1D7) (Huang et al. 2008, Dibble et al. 2012). This complex localizes to lysosomes and functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that inhibits the activity of Rheb (Menon et al. 2014, Demetriades et al. 2014). In the presence of growth factors or insulin, TSC releases its inhibitory activity on Rheb, thus allowing the activation of mTORC1.''',

    72608: '''Protein synthesis is accomplished through the process of translation of an mRNA sequence into a polypeptide chain. This process can be divided into three distinct stages:  initiation, elongation and termination. During the initiation phase, the two subunits of the ribosome are brought together to the translation start site on the mRNA where the polypeptide chain is to begin. Extension of the polypeptide chain occurs when a specific aminoacyl-tRNA, as determined by the template mRNA, binds an elongating ribosome. The protein chain is released from the ribosome when any one of three stop codons in the relevant reading frame on the mRNA is reached. Individual reactions at each one of these stages are catalyzed by a number of initiation, elongation and release factors, respectively.<br>Proteins destined for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contain a short sequence of hydrophobic amino acid residues (approximately 20 residues) at their N-termini. Upon protrusion of the signal sequence from the translating ribosome, the signal sequence is bound by the cytosolic signal recognition particle (SRP), translation is temporarily halted, and the SRP:nascent peptide:ribosome complex then docks with a SRP receptor complex on the ER membrane. There the nascent peptide:ribosome complex is transferred from the SRP complex to a translocon complex embedded in the ER membrane and reoriented so that the nascent polypeptide protrudes through a pore in the translocon into the ER lumen. Translation now resumes, the signal peptide is cleaved from the polypeptide by signal peptidase as the signal peptide emerges into the ER, and elongation proceeds with the growing polypeptide oriented into the ER lumen.<br>The 13 proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome are translated within the mitochondrion by mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) at the matrix face of the inner mitochondrial membrane.

Mitochondrial mRNAs have either no untranslated leaders or very short untranslated leaders of 1-3 nucleotides. Translation begins with N-formylmethionine, as in bacteria, and continues with cycles of aminoacyl-tRNA:TUFM:GTP binding, GTP hydrolysis and dissociation of TUFM:GDP. All 13 proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome are hydrophobic inner membrane proteins which are inserted cotranslationally into the membrane by an interaction with OXA1L. Translation is terminated when MTRF1L:GTP recognizes a UAA or UAG codon at the A-site of the mitoribosome.

    72612: '''Initiation of translation in the majority of eukaryotic cellular mRNAs depends on the 5'-cap (m7GpppN) and involves ribosomal scanning of the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) for an initiating AUG start codon. Therefore, this mechanism is often called cap-dependent translation initiation. Proximity to the cap, as well as the nucleotides surrounding an AUG codon, influence the efficiency of the start site recognition during the scanning process. However, if the recognition site is poor enough, scanning ribosomal subunits will ignore and skip potential starting AUGs, a phenomenon called leaky scanning. Leaky scanning allows a single mRNA to encode several proteins that differ in their amino-termini. Merrick (2010) provides an overview of this process and hghlights several features of it that remain incompletely understood.<p>Several eukaryotic cell and viral mRNAs initiate translation by an alternative mechanism that involves internal initiation rather than ribosomal scanning. These mRNAs contain complex nucleotide sequences, called internal ribosomal entry sites, where ribosomes bind in a cap-independent manner and start translation at the closest downstream AUG codon.<br>
Initiation on several viral and cellular mRNAs is cap-independent and is mediated by binding of the ribosome to internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements. These elements are often found in characteristically long structured regions on the 5'-UTR of an mRNA that may or may not have regulatory upstream open reading frames (uORFs). Both of these features on the 5'-end of the mRNA hinder ribosomal scanning, and thus promote a cap-independent translation initiation mechanism. IRESs act as specific translational enhancers that allow translation initiation to occur in response to specific stimuli and under the control of different trans-acting factors, as for example when cap-dependent protein synthesis is shut off during viral infection. Such regulatory elements have been identified in the mRNAs of growth factors, protooncogenes, angiogenesis factors, and apoptosis regulators, which are translated under a variety of stress conditions, including hypoxia, serum deprivation, irradiation and apoptosis. Thus, cap-independent translational control might have evolved to regulate cellular responses in acute but transient stress conditions that would otherwise lead to cell death, while the same mechanism is of major importance for viral mRNAs to bypass the shutting-off of host protein synthesis after infection. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and hepatitis C virus exemplify two distinct mechanisms of IRES-mediated initiation. In contrast to cap-dependent initiation, the eIF4A and eIF4G subunits of eIF4F bind immediately upstream of the EMCV initiation codon and promote binding of a 43S complex. Accordingly, EMCV initiation does not involve scanning and does not require eIF1, eIF1A, and the eIF4E subunit of eIF4F. Nonetheless, initiation on some EMCV-like IRESs requires additional non-canonical initiation factors, which alter IRES conformation and promote binding of eIF4A/eIF4G. Initiation on the hepatitis C virus IRES is simpler: a 43S complex containing only eIF2 and eIF3 binds directly to the initiation codon as a result of specific interaction of the IRES and the 40S subunit.''',

MMTV-insertion results in aberrant expression of the mouse mammary tumor gene int-3, which was subsequently discovered to represent the intracellular domain of Notch4 (Robbins et al. 1992, Uyttendaele et al. 1996).<br><br>NOTCH4 is prevalently expressed in endothelial cells (Uyttendaele et al. 1996). DLL4 and JAG1 act as ligands for NOTCH4 in human endothelial cells (Shawber et al. 2003, Shawber et al. 2007), but DLL4- and JAG1-mediated activation of NOTCH4 have not been confirmed in all cell types tested (Aste-Amezaga et al. 2010, James et al. 2014). The gamma secretase complex cleaves activated NOTCH4 receptor to release the intracellular domain fragment (NICD4) (Saxena et al. 2001, Das et al. 2004). NICD4 traffics to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor and stimulates expression of NOTCH target genes HES1, HES5, HEY1 and HEY2, as well as VEGFR3 and ACTA2 (Lin et al. 2002, Raafat et al.2004, Tsunematsu et al. 2004, Shawber et al. 2007, Tang et al. 2008, Bargo et al. 2010). NOTCH4 signaling can be downregulated by AKT1 phosphorylation-induced cytoplasmic retention (Ramakrishnan et al. 2015) as well as proteasome-dependent degradation upon FBXW7-mediated ubiquitination (Wu et al. 2001, Tsunematsu et al. 2004).<br><br>NOTCH4 was reported to inhibit NOTCH1 signaling in-cis, by binding to NOTCH1 and interfering with the S1 cleavage of NOTCH1, thus preventing production of functional NOTCH1 heterodimers at the cell surface (James et al. 2014).<br><br>NOTCH4 is involved in development of the vascular system. Overexpression of constitutively active Notch4 in mouse embryonic vasculature results in abnormal vessel structure and patterning (Uyttendaele et al. 2001). NOTCH4 may act to inhibit apoptosis of endothelial cells (MacKenzie et al. 2004).<br><br>Expression of int-3 interferes with normal mammary gland development in mice and promotes tumorigenesis. The phenotype of mice expressing int-3 in mammary glands is dependent on the presence of Rbpj (Raafat et al. 2009). JAG1 and NOTCH4 are upregulated in human ER+ breast cancers resistant to anti-estrogen therapy, which correlates with elevated expression of NOTCH target genes HES1, HEY1 and HEY2,  and is associated with increased population of breast cancer stem cells and distant metastases (Simoes et al. 2015). Development of int-3-induced mammary tumours  in mice depends on Kit and Pdgfra signaling (Raafat et al. 2006) and on int-3-induced activaton of NFKB signaling (Raafat et al. 2017). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), high NOTCH4 expression correlates with elevated HEY1 levels, increased cell proliferation and survival, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and cisplatin resistance (Fukusumi et al. 2018). In melanoma, however, exogenous NOTCH4 expression correlates with mesenchymal-to-epithelial-like transition and reduced invasiveness (Bonyadi Rad et al. 2016). NOTCH4 is frequently overexpressed in gastric cancer. Increased NOTCH4 levels correlate with activation of WNT signaling and gastric cancer progression (Qian et al. 2015).<br><br>NOTCH4 is expressed in adipocytes and may promote adipocyte differentiation (Lai et al. 2013).<br><br>During Dengue virus infection, DLL1, DLL4, NOTCH4 and HES1 are upregulated in interferon-beta (INFB) dependent manner (Li et al. 2015). NOTCH4 signaling may be affected by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, as the EBV protein BARF0 binds to NOTCH4 (Kusano and Raab-Traub 2001). ''',

Activation of presynaptic acetylcholine receptors leads to influx of Ca2+ and sufficient increase in local Ca2+ concentrations which could be due to either direct or indirect Ca2+ entry. Direct Ca2+ entry through acetylcholine receptors containing alpha3 beta4 receptors is sufficient for the release of noradrenaline  in hippocampus. Indirect Ca2+ increase could be due to Na+ dependent depolarization and activation of voltage dependent calcium channels (VDCC) as in the case of dopamine release. Local Ca2+ increase could also be due to an initial Ca2+ influx through acetlycholine homomeric receptors containing alpha7 subunits and further increase in Ca2+ is elicited due to Ca2+ induced Ca2+ release (CICR) that involves the ryanodine receptors in the ER and the IP3 receptors. This mechanism is used in hippocampal mossyfibre pathway.

SUMOylation can alter enzymatic activity and protein stability or it can serve to recruit additional factors. For example, SUMOylation of Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) causes TDG to lose affinity for its product, an abasic site opposite a G residue, and thus increases turnover of the enzyme.

    8940506: '''Several transcription factors have been implicated in regulation of the RUNX2 gene transcription. Similar to the RUNX1 gene, the RUNX2 gene expression can be regulated from the proximal P2 promoter or the distal P1 promoter (reviewed in Li and Xiao 2007).<br>Activated estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) binds estrogen response elements (EREs) in the P2 promoter and stimulates RUNX2 transcription (Kammerer et al. 2013). Estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRA) binds EREs or estrogen-related response elements (ERREs) in the P2 promoter of RUNX2. When ERRA is bound to its co-factor PPARG1CA (PGC1A), it stimulates RUNX2 transcription. When bound to its co-factor PPARG1CB (PGC1B), ERRA represses RUNX2 transcription (Kammerer et al. 2013).<br>TWIST1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, stimulates RUNX2 transcription by binding to the E1-box in the P2 promoter (Yang, Yang et al. 2011). TWIST proteins also interact with the DNA-binding domain of RUNX2 to modulate its activity during skeletogenesis (Bialek et al. 2004). Schnurri-3 (SHN3) is another protein that interacts with RUNX2 to decrease its availability in the nucleus and therefore its activity (Jones et al. 2006). In contrast, RUNX2 and SATB2 interact to enhance the expression of osteoblast-specific genes (Dobreva et al. 2006). Formation of the heterodimer with CBFB (CBF-beta) also enhances the transcriptional activity of RUNX2 (Kundu et al. 2002, Yoshida et al. 2002, Otto et al. 2002).<br>Transcription of RUNX2 from the proximal promoter is inhibited by binding of the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) activated by dexamethasone (DEXA) to a glucocorticoid receptor response element (GRE), which is also present in the human promoter (Zhang et al. 2012).<br>NKX3-2 (BAPX1), required for embryonic development of the axial skeleton (Tribioli and Lufkin 1999), binds the distal (P1) promoter of the RUNX2 gene and inhibits its transcription (Lengner et al. 2005). RUNX2-P1 transcription is also autoinhibited by RUNX2-P1, which binds to RUNX2 response elements in the P1 promoter of RUNX2 (Drissi et al. 2000). In contrast, binding of RUNX2-P2 to the proximal P2 promoter autoactivates transcription of RUNX2-P2 (Ducy et al. 1999). Binding of a homeodomain transcription factor DLX5, and possibly DLX6, to the RUNX2 P1 promoter stimulates RUNX2 transcription (Robledo et al. 2002, Lee et al. 2005). The homeobox transcription factor MSX2 can bind to DLX5 sites in the promoter of RUNX2 and inhibit transcription of RUNX2-P1 (Lee et al. 2005).<br>Translocation of RUNX2 protein to the nucleus is inhibited by binding to non-activated STAT1 (Kim et al. 2003).<br>Several E3 ubiquitin ligases were shown to polyubiquitinate RUNX2, targeting it for proteasome-mediated degradation: FBXW7a (Kumar et al. 2015), STUB1 (CHIP) (Li et al. 2008), SMURF1 (Zhao et al. 2003, Yang et al. 2014), WWP1 (Jones et al. 2006), and SKP2 (Thacker et al. 2016).''',

Renin, an aspartyl protease specific for angiotensinogen, is secreted into the bloodstream by juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney in response to a drop in blood pressure. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to yield a decapaptide, angiotensin I (angiotensin-1, angiotensin-(1-10)). Circulating renin can also bind the membrane-localized (pro)renin receptor (ATP6AP2) which increases its catalytic activity. After cleavage of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I by renin, two C-terminal amino acid residues of angiotensin I are removed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), located on the surface of endothelial cells, to yield angiotensin II (angiotensin-2, angiotensin-(1-8)), the active peptide that causes vasoconstriction, resorption of sodium and chloride, excretion of potassium, water retention, and aldosterone secretion.<br>More recently other, more tissue-localized pathways leading to angiotensin II and alternative derivatives of angiotensinogen have been identified (reviewed in Kramkowski et al. 2006, Kumar et al. 2007, Fyhrquist and Saijonmaa 2008, Becari et al. 2011). Chymase, cathepsin G, and cathepsin X (cathepsin Z) can each cleave angiotensin I to yield angiotensin II. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cleaves 1 amino acid residue from angiotensin I (angiotensin-(1-10)) to yield angiotensin-(1-9), which can be cleaved by ACE to yield angiotensin-(1-7).

BMAL1:CLOCK/NPAS2 activates transcription of CRY, PER, and several other genes in the morning. Levels of PER and CRY proteins rise during the day and inhibit expression of CRY, PER, and other BMAL1:CLOCK/NPAS2-activated genes in the afternoon and evening. During the night CRY and PER proteins are targeted for degradation by phosphorylation and polyubiquitination, allowing the cycle to commence again in the morning. <br>Transcription of the BMAL1 (ARNTL) gene is controlled by ROR-alpha and REV-ERBA (NR1D1), both of which are targets of BMAL1:CLOCK/NPAS2 in mice and both of which compete for the same element (RORE) in the BMAL1 promoter. ROR-alpha (RORA) activates transcription of BMAL1; REV-ERBA represses transcription of BMAL1. This mutual control forms a secondary, reinforcing loop of the circadian clock. REV-ERBA shows strong circadian rhythmicity and confers circadian expression on BMAL1. <br>BMAL1 can form heterodimers with either CLOCK or NPAS2, which act redundantly but show different tissue specificity.

    109579: '''Hemostasis is a physiological response that culminates in the arrest of bleeding from an injured vessel. Under normal conditions the vascular endothelium supports vasodilation, inhibits platelet adhesion and activation, suppresses coagulation, enhances fibrin cleavage and is anti-inflammatory in character. Under acute vascular trauma, vasoconstrictor mechanisms predominate and the endothelium becomes prothrombotic, procoagulatory and proinflammatory in nature. This is achieved by a reduction of endothelial dilating agents: adenosine, NO and prostacyclin; and by the direct action of ADP, serotonin and thromboxane on vascular smooth muscle cells to elicit their contraction (Becker et al. 2000). 

The chief trigger for the change in endothelial function that leads to the formation of a haemostatic thrombus is the loss of the endothelial cell barrier between blood and extracellular matrix components (Ruggeri 2002). Circulating platelets identify and discriminate areas of endothelial lesions; here, they adhere to the exposed sub endothelium. Their interaction with the various thrombogenic substrates and locally generated or released agonists results in platelet activation. This process is described as possessing two stages, firstly, adhesion -  the initial tethering to a surface, and secondly aggregation - the platelet-platelet cohesion (Savage & Cattaneo et al. 2001).

Three mechansism contribute to the loss of blood following vessel injury. The vessel constricts, reducing the loss of blood. Platelets adhere to the site of injury, become activated and aggregate with fibrinogen into a soft plug that limits blood loss, a process termed primary hemostasis. Proteins and small molecules are released from granules by activated platelets,  stimulating the plug formation process. Fibrinogen from plasma forms bridges between activated platelets. These events initiate the clotting cascade (secondary hemostasis). Negatively-charged phospholipids exposed at the site of injury and on activated platelets interact with tissue factor, leading to a cascade of reactions that culminates with the formation of an insoluble fibrin clot.''',

IRAK-2 loss-of-function mutants, with mutated TRAF6-binding motifs, could no longer activate NF-kB and could no longer stimulate TRAF-6 ubiquitination (Keating SE et al 2007). Furthermore, the proxyvirus protein A52 - an inhibitor of all IL-1R/TLR pathways to NF-kB activation, was found to interact with both IRAK-2 and TRAF6, but not IRAK-1. Further work showed that A52 inhibits IRAK-2 functions, whereas association with TRAF6 results in A52-induced MAPK activation.

    416793: '''Excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain is carried out by glutamate receptors through the activation of both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors.  Ionotropic glutamate receptors are of three subtypes based on distinct physiologic properties and their differential binding of exogenous ligands namely  NMDA (N-methyl D-aspartate), AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) and Kainate . The ionotropic receptors are glutamate gated ion channels that initiate signaling by influx of ions, and are comprised of subunits with distinct structures and distinguished based on their agonist binding. Even though all three types of receptors are found at the glutamatergic synapses yet they exhibit great diversity in the synaptic distribution. The metabotropic glutamate receptors are a family of G-protein coupled receptors that are slow acting.  Fast excitatory synaptic transmission is carried out through AMPA receptors. Post-synaptic transmission involves binding of the ligand such as glutamate/AMPA to the AMPA receptor resulting in the Na influx which causes depolarization of the membrane. NMDA receptors are blocked by Mg at resting membrane potential. NMDA receptors are activated upon coincident depolarization and glutamate binding are activated following AMPA receptor activation.NMDA receptors are blocked by Mg at resting <br>membrane potential. NMDA receptors are Ca permeable and their activity leads to increase in Ca which, leads to upregulation of AMPA receptors at the synapse which causes the long lasting excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) which forms the basis of long term potentiation (LTP). LTP is one form of synaptic plasticity wherein the strength of the synapses is enhanced by either change in the number, increase in the efficacy by phosphorylation or change in the type of receptors. Phosphorylation of AMPA receptors changes the localization of the receptors, increases the single channel conductance, and increases the probability of open channel. GluR1 has four phosphorylation sites; serine 818 (S818) is phosphorylated by PKC and is necessary for LTP, serine 831 (S831) is phosphorylated by CaMKII  that increases the delivery of receptors to the synapse and also increased their single channel conductance, threonine (T840) is implicated in LTP. Serine 845 (S845) is phosphorylated by PKA which regulates open channel probability.  Long term depression is another form of plasticity wherein the number of AMPA receptors is diminished by either phosphorylation of GluR2 at Ser880 or dephosphorylation of GluR1 by protein phosphatase1, protein phosphatase 2A and protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin).''',
    5684249: '''Tumor progression locus-2 (TPL2, also known as COT and MAP3K8) functions as a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase (MAP3K) in various stress-responsive signaling cascades. MAP3K8 (TPL2) mediates phosphorylation of MAP2Ks (MEK1/2) which in turn phosphorylate MAPK (ERK1/2) (Gantke T et al., 2011).<p>In the absence of extra-cellular signals, cytosolic MAP3K8 (TPL2) is held inactive in the complex with ABIN2 (TNIP2) and NFkB p105 (NFKB1) (Beinke S et al., 2003; Waterfield MR et al., 2003; Lang V et al., 2004). This interaction stabilizes MAP3K8 (TPL2) but also prevents MAP3K8 and NFkB from activating their downstream signaling cascades by inhibiting the kinase activity of MAP3K8 and the proteolysis of NFkB precursor protein p105. Upon activation of MAP3K8 by various stimuli (such as LPS, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta), IKBKB phosphorylates NFkB p105 (NFKB1) at Ser927 and Ser932, which trigger p105 proteasomal degradation and releases MAP3K8 from the complex (Beinke S et al., 2003, 2004; Roget K et al., 2012). Simultaneously, MAP3K8 is activated by auto- and/or transphosphorylation (Gantke T et al. 2011; Yang HT et al. 2012). The released active MAP3K8 phosphorylates its substrates, MAP2Ks. The free MAP3K8, however, is also unstable and is targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation, thus restricting prolonged activation of MAP3K8 (TPL2) and its downstream signaling pathways (Waterfield MR et al. 2003; Cho J et al., 2005). Furthermore, partially degraded NFkB p105 (NFKB1) into p50 can dimerize with other NFkB family members to regulate the transcription of target genes.<p>MAP3K8 activity is thought to regulate the dynamics of transcription factors that control an expression of diverse genes involved in growth, differentiation, and inflammation. Suppressing the MAP3K8 kinase activity with selective inhibitors, such as C8-chloronaphthyridine-3-carbonitrile, caused a significant reduction in TNFalpha production in LPS- and IL-1beta-induced both primary human monocytes and human blood (Hall JP et al. 2007). Similar results have been reported for mouse LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells (Hirata K et al. 2010). Moreover, LPS-stimulated macrophages derived from Map3k8 knockout mice secreted lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFalpha, Cox2, Pge2 and CXCL1 (Dumitru CD et al. 2000; Eliopoulos AG et al. 2002). Additionally, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and macrophages from Map3k8 knockout mice showed significantly lower expression of IL-1beta in response to LPS, poly IC and LPS/MDP (Mielke et al., 2009). However, several other studies seem to contradict these findings and Map3k8 deficiency in mice has been also reported to enhance pro-inflammatory profiles. Map3k8 deficiency in LPS-stimulated macrophages was associated with an increase in nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) expression (López-Peláez et al., 2011). Similarly, expression of IRAK-M, whose function is to compete with IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK) family of kinases, was decreased in Map3k8-/- macrophages while levels of TNF and IL6 were elevated (Zacharioudaki et al., 2009). Moreover, significantly higher inflammation level was observed in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-treated Map3k8-/- mouse skin compared to WT skin (DeCicco-Skinner K. et al., 2011). Additionally, MAP3K8 activity is associated with NFkB inflammatory pathway. High levels of active p65 NFkB were observed in the nucleus of Map3k8 -/- mouse keratinocytes that dramatically increased within 15-30 minutes of TPA treatment. Similarly, increased p65 NFkB was observed in Map3k8-deficient BMDC both basally and after stimulation with LPS when compared to wild type controls (Mielke et al., 2009). The data opposes the findings that Map3k8-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts and human Jurkat T cells with kinase domain-deficient protein have a reduction in NFkB activation but only when certain stimuli are administered (Lin et al., 1999; Das S et al., 2005). Thus, it is possible that whether MAP3K8 serves more of a pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory role may depend on cell- or tissue type and on stimuli (LPS vs. TPA, etc.) (Mielke et al., 2009; DeCicco-Skinner K. et al., 2012).<p>MAP3K8 has been also studied in the context of carcinogenesis, however the physiological role of MAP3K8 in the etiology of human cancers is also convoluted (Vougioukalaki M et al., 2011; DeCicco-Skinner K. et al., 2012).''',

These myogenic factors dimerize with E-proteins such as E12/E47, ITF-2 and HEB to form heterodimeric complexes that bind to a conserved DNA sequence known as the E box, which is present in the promoters and enhancers of most muscle-specific genes. Myocyte enhancer binding factor 2 (MEF2), which is a member of the MADS box family, also plays an important role in muscle differentiation. MEF2 activates transcription by binding to the consensus sequence, called the MEF2-binding site, which is also found in the control regions of numerous muscle-specific genes. MEF2 and myogenic bHLH proteins synergistically activate expression of muscle-specific genes via protein-protein interactions between DNA-binding domains of these heterologous classes of transcription factors. Members of the MyoD and MEF2 family of transcription factors associate combinatorially to control myoblast specification, differentiation and proliferation.''',

Defects in the SFTPC gene result in protein misfolding, misrouting and/or misprocessing resulting in accumulation of partially-processed, inactive pro-SFTPC in alveoli causing cell toxicity. Defects in SFTPC can cause pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction 2 (SMDP2; MIM:610913), a rare lung disorder due to impaired surfactant homeostasis characterised by alveoli filling with floccular material. Cellular responses to the misfolded pro-SFTPC products include ER stress, the activation of reactive oxygen species and autophagy.

This occurs when C1q binds to IgM or IgG complexed with antigens, a single IgM can initiate the pathway while multiple IgGs are needed, or when C1q binds directly to the surface of the pathogen. Binding leads to conformational changes in C1q, activating the serine protease activity of C1r, which then cleaves C1s, another serine protease. The C1r:C1s component is now capable of splitting C4 and C2 to produce the classical C3-convertase C4b2a. C1r and C1s are additionally controlled by C1-inhibitor.(Kerr MA 1980)<br>The lectin pathway is similar in operation but has different components. <p>Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolins (L-ficolin, M-ficolin and H-ficolin) initiate the lectin pathway cascade by binding to specific carbohydrate patterns on pathogenic cell surfaces. MBL and ficolins circulate in plasma in complexes with homodimers of MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP) (Fujita et al. 2004; Hajela et al. 2002). Upon binding of human lectin (MBL or ficolins) to the target surface the complex of lectin:MASP undergoes conformational changes, which results in the activation of MASPs by cleavage (Matsushita M et al. 2000; Fujita et al. 2004). Activated MASPs become capable of C4 and C2 cleavage, giving rise to the same C3 convertase C4b:C2a as the classical pathway. ''',

These genotoxic chemicals generate major lesions like 1-methyladenine, 3-methyladenine, 3-methylcytosine and O6-methylguanine in DNA. Cells have built in repair mechanisms against such toxic molecules. For example, 3-methyladeninie-DNA glycosylases excise some methylated bases while MGMT/hAGT protein transfers alkyl groups from others lesions onto cysteine residues. E.coli AlkB protein has a unique function wherein 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine are demethylated by a combination of oxidative decarboxylation and hydroxylation activities. AlkB and its human orthologs, ALKBH2 (ABH2) and ALKBH3 (ABH3) belong to alpha-ketoglutarate deoxygenase family of enzymes that oxidize chemically inert compounds in the presence of alpha-ketoglutarate, oxygen and ferrous ions. As a byproduct of these chemical reactions, formaldehyde is released in the case of methylated lesions and acetaldehyde in the case 1-ethyladenine in DNA. CO2 and succinate are also released in an intermediate step not shown in the following illustration. Unlike other mechanisms which involve some kind of nuclease activities, this type of repair mechanism leaves the repaired bases intact by just removing the reactive alkyl groups that get bound to the bases thereby effecting accurate restoration of damaged DNA sequences (Trewick et al. 2002, Duncan et al. 2002, Sedgwick 2004).''',

    375906: '''Nephrin (NPHS1) is a member of the Super-IgG-Molecule family and is most prominently expressed in kidney podocytes. It is a major if not the most important structural component of the slit diaphragm, a modified adherens junction inbetween these cells. NPHS1 has an extracellular domain that contains eight distal IgG like domains and one proximal fibronectin type III domain, a transmembrane domain and a short intracellular domain. NPHS1 molecules show both homophilic and heterophilic interactions. Among heterophilic interaction partners, slit diaphragm proteins such as Kin of IRRE-like protein 1 (KIRREL, Nephrin-like protein 1, NEPH1),  KIRREL3 (NEPH2) and KIRREL2 (NEPH3) were shown to stabilize the slit diaphragm structure. Intracellularly Podocin (NPHS2), CD2 associated protein (CD2AP) and adherins junction associated proteins like IQGAP, MAGI, CASK and spectrins all interact with NPHS1. Hence it seems to play a major role in organizing the molecular structure of the slit diaphragm itself and via its binding partners links it to the actin cytoskeleton. NPHS1 tyrosine phosphorylation by the Src kinase FYN initiates the PI3K-AKT signaling cascade, which seems to promote antiapoptotic signals.''',

Netrin-1 is the most studied member of the family and has been shown to play a crucial role in neuronal navigation during nervous system development mainly through its interaction with its receptors DCC and UNC5.

    375908: '''The Roundabout (ROBO) family encodes transmembrane receptors that regulate axonal guidance and cell migration. The major function of the Robo receptors is to mediate repulsion of the navigating growth cones. There are four human Robo homologues, ROBO1, ROBO2, ROBO3 and ROBO4. Most of the ROBOs have the similar ectodomain architecture as the cell adhesion molecules, with five Ig domains followed by three FN3 repeats, except for ROBO4. ROBO4 has two Ig and two FN3 repeats. The cytoplasmic domains of ROBO receptors are in general poorly conserved. However, there are four short conserved cytoplasmic sequence motifs, named CC0-3, that serve as binding sites for adaptor proteins. The ligands for the human ROBO1 and ROBO2 receptors are the three SLIT proteins SLIT1, SLIT2, and SLIT3; all of the SLIT proteins contain a tandem of four LRR (leucine rich repeat) domains at the N-terminus, termed D1-D4, followed by six EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like domains, a laminin G like domain (ALPS), three EGF-like domains, and a C-terminal cysteine knot domain. Most SLIT proteins are cleaved within the EGF-like region by unknown proteases (reviewed by Hohenster 2008, Ypsilanti and Chedotal 2014, Blockus and Chedotal 2016). NELL2 is a ligand for ROBO3 (Jaworski et al. 2015).<br><br>SLIT protein binding modulates ROBO interactions with the cytosolic adaptors. The cytoplasmic domain of ROBO1 and ROBO2 determines the repulsive responses of these receptors. Based on the studies from both invertebrate and vertebrate organisms it has been inferred that ROBO induces growth cone repulsion by controlling cytoskeletal dynamics via either Abelson kinase (ABL) and Enabled (Ena), or RAC1 activity (reviewed by Hohenster 2008, Ypsilanti and Chedotal 2014, Blockus and Chedotal 2016). While there is some redundancy in the function of ROBO receptors, ROBO1 is implicated as the predominant receptor for axon guidance in ventral tracts, and ROBO2 is the predominant receptor for axon guidance in dorsal tracts. ROBO2 also repels neuron cell bodies from the floor plate (Kim et al. 2011).<p>In addition to regulating axon guidance, ROBO1 and ROBO2 receptors are also implicated in regulation of proliferation and transition of primary to intermediate neuronal progenitors through a poorly characterized cross-talk with NOTCH-mediated activation of HES1 transcription (Borrell et al. 2012).<p>Thalamocortical axon extension is regulated by neuronal activity-dependent transcriptional regulation of ROBO1 transcription. Lower neuronal activity correlates with increased ROBO1 transcription, possibly mediated by the NFKB complex (Mire et al. 2012).<p>It is suggested that the homeodomain transcription factor NKX2.9 stimulates transcription of ROBO2, which is involved in regulation of motor axon exit from the vertebrate spinal code (Bravo-Ambrosio et al. 2012).<p>Of the four ROBO proteins, ROBO4 is not involved in neuronal system development but is, instead, involved in angiogenesis. The interaction of ROBO4 with SLIT3 is involved in proliferation, motility and chemotaxis of endothelial cells, and accelerates formation of blood vessels (Zhang et al. 2009).''',

TFAP2A, TFAP2C, as well as TFAP2B can directly stimulate the expression of ERBB2, another important breast cancer gene (Bosher et al. 1996). Association of TFAP2A with the YY1 transcription factor significantly increases the ERBB2 transcription rate (Begon et al. 2005). In addition to ERBB2, the expression of another receptor tyrosine kinase, KIT, is also stimulated by TFAP2A and TFAP2B (Huang et al. 1998), while the expression of the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase ligand VEGFA is repressed by TFAP2A (Ruiz et al. 2004, Li et al. 2012). TFAP2A stimulates transcription of the transforming growth factor alpha (TGFA) gene (Wang et al. 1997). TFAP2C regulates EGFR expression in luminal breast cancer (De Andrade et al. 2016).

The primary method of HIV infection is by sexual exposure while nonsexual HIV transmission also can occur through transfusion with contaminated blood products, injection drug use, occupational exposure,accidental needlesticks or mother-to-child transmission.

    8862825: '''Post-mitotic neurons do not have an active cell cycle. However, deregulation of Cyclin Dependent Kinase-5 (CDK5) activity in these neurons can aberrantly activate various components of cell cycle leading to neuronal death (Chang et al. 2012). Random activation of cell cycle proteins has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders (Yang et al. 2003, Lopes et al. 2009). CDK5 is not activated by the canonical cyclins, but binds to its own specific partners, CDK5R1 and CDK5R2 (aka p35 and p39, respectively) (Tsai et al. 1994, Tang et al. 1995). Expression of p35 is nearly ubiquitous, whereas p39 is largely expressed in the central nervous system. A variety of neurotoxic insults such as beta-amyloid (A-beta), ischemia, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress disrupt the intracellular calcium homeostasis in neurons, thereby leading to the activation of calpain, which cleaves p35 into p25 and p10 (Lee et al. 2000). p25 has a six-fold longer half-life compared to p35 and lacks the membrane anchoring signal, which results in its constitutive activation and mislocalization of the CDK5:p25 complex to the cytoplasm and the nucleus. There, CDK5:p25 is able to access and phosphorylate a variety of atypical targets, triggering a cascade of neurotoxic pathways that culminate in neuronal death. One such neurotoxic pathway involves CDK5-mediated random activation of cell cycle proteins which culminate in neuronal death. Exposure of primary cortical neurons to oligomeric beta-amyloid (1-42) hyper-activates CDK5 due to p25 formation, which in turn phosphorylates CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C. CDK5 phosphorylates CDC25A at S40, S116 and S261; CDC25B at S50, T69, S160, S321 and S470; and CDC25C at T48, T67, S122, T130, S168 and S214. CDK5-mediated phosphorylation of CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C not only increases their phosphatase activities but also facilitates their release from 14-3-3 inhibitory binding. CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C in turn activate CDK1, CDK2 and CDK4 kinases causing neuronal death. Consistent with this mechanism, higher CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C activities were observed in human Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical samples, as compared to age-matched controls. Inhibition of CDC25 isoforms confers neuroprotection to beta-amyloid toxicity, which underscores the contribution of this pathway to AD pathogenesis''',

TP53-mediated regulation probably ensures increased protein level of DNA repair genes under genotoxic stress.<p>TP53 directly stimulates transcription of several genes involved in DNA mismatch repair, including MSH2 (Scherer et al. 2000, Warnick et al. 2001), PMS2 and MLH1 (Chen and Sadowski 2005). TP53 also directly stimulates transcription of DDB2, involved in nucleotide excision repair (Tan and Chu 2002), and FANCC, involved in the Fanconi anemia pathway that repairs DNA interstrand crosslinks (Liebetrau et al. 1997). Other p53 targets that can influence DNA repair functions are RRM2B (Kuo et al. 2012), XPC (Fitch et al. 2003), GADD45A (Amundson et al. 2002), CDKN1A (Cazzalini et al. 2010) and PCNA (Xu and Morris 1999). Interestingly, the responsiveness of some of these DNA repair genes to p53 activation has been shown in human cells but not for orthologous mouse genes (Jegga et al. 2008, Tan and Chu 2002). Contrary to the positive modulation of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and mismatch repair (MMR), p53 can negatively modulate base excision repair (BER), by down-regulating the endonuclease APEX1 (APE1), acting in concert with SP1 (Poletto et al. 2016).<p>Expression of several DNA repair genes is under indirect TP53 control, through TP53-mediated stimulation of cyclin K (CCNK) expression (Mori et al. 2002).

Genes whose transcription is regulated by the complex of CCNK and CDK12 are mainly involved in the repair of DNA double strand breaks and/or the Fanconi anemia pathway (Blazek et al. 2011, Cheng et al. 2012, Bosken et al. 2014, Bartkowiak and Greenleaf 2015, Ekumi et al. 2015).''',

    5688424: '''Ubiquitination, the modification of proteins by the covalent attachment of ubiquitin (Ub), is a key regulatory mechanism for many many cellular processes, including protein degradation by the 26S proteasome. Ub conjugates linked via lysine 48 (K48) target substrates to the proteasome, whereas those linked via any of the six other Ub lysines can alter the function of the modified protein without leading to degradation. Deubiquitination, the reversal of this modification, regulates the function of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) catalyze the removal of Ub and regulate Ub-mediated pathways.<br><br>Given that Ub is covalently-linked to proteins destined to be degraded, it is a surprisingly long-lived protein in vivo (Haas & Bright 1987). This is due to the removal of Ub from its conjugates by DUBs prior to proteolysis. This may represent a quality control mechanism that prevents the degradation of proteins that were inappropriately tagged for degradation (Lam et al. 1997).  DUBs are responsible for processing inactive Ub precursors and for keeping the 26S proteasome free of unanchored Ub chains that compete for Ub-binding sites. <br><br>DUBs can be grouped into five families based on their conserved catalytic domains (Amerik & Hochstrasser 2004). Four of these families are thiol proteases and comprise the bulk of DUBs, while the fifth family is a small group of Ub specific metalloproteases. <br><br>Thiol protease DUBs contain a Cys-His-Asp/Asn catalytic triad in which the Asp/Asn functions to polarize and orient the His, while the His serves as a general acid/base by both priming the catalytic Cys for nucleophilic attack on the (iso)peptide carbonyl carbon and by donating a proton to the lysine epsilon-amino leaving group. The nucleophilic attack of the catalytic Cys on the carbonyl carbon produces a negatively charged transition state that is stabilized by an oxyanion hole composed of hydrogen bond donors. A Cys-carbonyl acyl intermediate ensues and is then hydrolyzed by nucleophilic attack of a water molecule to liberate a protein C-terminal carboxylate and regenerate the enzyme. Ub binding often causes structural rearrangements necessary for catalysis. Many DUBs are inactivated by oxidation of the catalytic cysteine to sulphenic acid (single bond SOH) (Cotto-Rios et al. 2012, Lee et al. 2013). This can be reversed by reduction with DTT or glutathione. The sulphenic acid can be irreversibly oxidized to sulphinic acid (single bond SO2H) or sulphonic acid (single bond SO3H). <br> <br>Thiol proteases are reversibly inhibited by Ub C-terminal aldehyde, forming a thio-hemiacetal between the aldehyde group and the active site thiol.''',

    5610668: '''Hedgehog is a secreted morphogen that has evolutionarily conserved roles in body organization by regulating the activity of the Ci/Gli transcription factor family. In Drosophila in the absence of Hh signaling, full-length Ci is partially degraded by the proteasome to generate a truncated repressor form that translocates to the nucleus to represses Hh-responsive genes. Binding of Hh ligand to the Patched (PTC) receptor allows the 7-pass transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO) to be activated in an unknown manner, disrupting the partial proteolysis of Ci and allowing the full length activator form to accumulate (reviewed in Ingham et al, 2011; Briscoe and Therond, 2013).  <br>While many of the core components of Hh signaling are conserved from flies to humans, the pathways do show points of significant divergence. Notably, the human genome encodes three Ci homologues, GLI1, 2 and 3 that each play slightly different roles in regulating Hh responsive genes. GLI3 is the primary repressor of Hh signaling in vertebrates, and is converted to the truncated GLI3R repressor form in the absence of Hh. GLI2 is a potent activator of transcription in the presence of Hh but contributes only minimally to the repression function. While a minor fraction of GLI2 protein is processed into the repressor form in the absence of Hh, the majority is either fully degraded by the proteasome or sequestered in the full-length form in the cytosol by protein-protein interactions. GLI1 lacks the repression domain and appears to be an obligate transcriptional activator (reviewed in Briscoe and Therond, 2013).<br> Vertebrate but not fly Hh signaling also depends on the movement of pathway components through the primary cilium. The primary cilium is a non-motile microtubule based structure whose construction and maintenance depends on intraflagellar transport (IFT). Anterograde IFT moves molecules from the ciliary base along the axoneme to the ciliary tip in a manner that requires the microtubule-plus-end directed kinesin KIF3 motor complex and the IFT-B protein complex, while retrograde IFT back to the ciliary base depends on the minus-end directed dynein motor and the IFT-A complex. Genetic screens have identified a number of cilia-related proteins that are required both to maintain Hh in the 'off' state and to transduce the signal when the pathway is activated (reviewed in Hui and Angers, 2011; Goetz and Anderson, 2010).

It is now clear that MMPs regulate ECM turnover not only by cleaving ECM components, but also by the regulation of cell signalling, and that some MMPs are beneficial and may be drug anti-targets. Thus, MMPs have important roles in many processes including embryo development, morphogenesis, tissue homeostasis and remodeling. They are implicated in several diseases such as arthritis, periodontitis, glomerulonephritis, atherosclerosis, tissue ulceration, and cancer cell invasion and metastasis. All MMPs are synthesized as preproenzymes. Alternate splice forms are known, leading to nuclear localization of select MMPs.

Upon photon absorption, 11cRAL isomerizes to all trans retinal (atRAL), changing the conformation of opsin to a form that can activate the regulatory G protein transducin (Gt). The alpha subunit of Gt activates phosphodiesterase which hydrolyses cGMP to 5'-GMP. A high level of cGMP keeps cGMP-gated cation channels open, so lower cGMP levels close these channels and hyperpolarize the cell. The hyperpolarization spreads passively to the synapse located at the opposite end of the rod, where it subsequently closes voltage-gated calcium channels. Vesicular release of the neurotransmitter glutamate subsides as the intracellular calcium levels drop. This diminution of neurotransmitter release relays the light signal to postsynaptic neurons.

    5340342: '''Methylation of cytosine is catalyzed by a family of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs): DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B transfer methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to cytosine, producing 5-methylcytosine and homocysteine (reviewed in Klose and Bird 2006, Ooi et al. 2009, Jurkowska et al. 2011, Moore et al. 2013). (DNMT2 appears to methylate RNA rather than DNA.) DNMT1, the first enzyme discovered, preferentially methylates hemimethylated CG motifs that are produced by replication (template strand methylated, synthesized strand unmethylated). Thus it maintains existing methylation through cell division. DNMT3A and DNMT3B catalyze de novo methylation at unmethylated sites that include both CG dinucleotides and non-CG motifs.<br>DNA from adult humans contains about 0.76 to 1.00 mole percent 5-methylcytosine (Ehrlich et al. 1982, reviewed in Klose and Bird 2006, Ooi et al. 2009, Moore et al. 2013). Methylation of DNA occurs at cytosines that are mainly located in CG dinucleotides. CG dinucleotides are unevenly distributed in the genome. Promoter regions tend to have a high CG-content, forming so-called CG-islands (CGIs), while the CG-content in the remaining part of the genome is much lower. CGIs tend to be unmethylated, while the majority of CGs outside CGIs are methylated. Methylation in promoters and first exons tends to repress transcription while methylation in gene bodies (regions of genes downstream of the promoter and first exon) correlates with transcription (reviewed in Ehrlich and Lacey 2013, Kulis et al. 2013). Proteins such as MeCP2 and MBDs specifically bind 5-methylcytosine and may recruit other factors.<br>Mammalian development has two major episodes of genome-wide demethylation and remethylation (reviewed in Zhou 2012, Guibert and Weber 2013, Hackett and Surani 2013, Dean 2014). In mice about 1 day after fertilization the paternal genome is actively demethylated by TET proteins together with thymine DNA glycosylase and the maternal genome is demethylated by passive dilution during replication, however methylation at imprinted sites is maintained. The genome has its lowest methylation level about 3.5 days post-fertilization. Remethylation occurs by 6.5 days post-fertilization. The second demethylation-remethylation event occurs in primordial germ cells of the developing embryo about 12.5 days post-fertilization. DNMT3A and DNMT3B, together with the non-catalytic DNMT3L, play major roles in the remethylation events (reviewed in Chen and Chan 2014). How the methyltransferases are directed to particular regions of the genome remains an area of active research. The mechanisms at each locus may differ in detail but a connection between histone modifications and DNA methylation has been observed (reviewed in Rose and Klose 2014).''',
    187576: '''During G1, the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) is kept in check by the CDK inhibitors (CKIs) p27 and p21, thereby preventing premature entry into S phase (see Guardavaccaro and Pagano, 2006). These two CKIs are degraded in late G1 phase by the ubiquitin pathway (Pagano et al., 1995; Bloom et al., 2003) involving the ubiquitin ligase SCF(Skp2) (Tsvetkov et al., 1999; Carrano et al., 1999; Sutterluty et al., 1999, Bornstein et al., 2003) and the cell-cycle regulatory protein Cks1 (Ganoth et al., 2001; Spruck et al 2001; Bornstein et al., 2003). Recognition of p27 by SCF(Skp2) and its subsequent ubiquitination is dependent upon Cyclin E/A:Cdk2- mediated phosphorylation at Thr 187 of p27 (Montagnoli et al., 1999). There is evidence that Cyclin A/B:Cdk1 complexes can also bind and phosphorylate p27 on Th187 (Nakayama et al., 2004). Degradation of polyubiquitinated p27 by the 26S proteasome promotes the activity of CDKs in driving cells into S phase. (Montagnoli et al., 1999; Tsvetkov et al., 1999, Carrano et al 1999). The mechanism of SCF(Skp2)-mediated degradation of p21 is similar to that of p27 in terms of its requirements for the presence of Cks1 and of Cdk2/cyclin E/A (Bornstein et al.,2003; Wang et al., 2005). In addition, as observed for p27, p21 phosphorylation at a specific site (Ser130) stimulates its ubiquitination. In contrast to p27, however, ubiquitination of p21 can take place in the absence of phosphorylation, although with less efficiency (Bornstein et al.,2003).  SCF(Skp2)-mediated degradation of p27/p21 continues from late G1  through M-phase. During G0 and from early G1 to G1/S, Skp2 is degraded by the anaphase promoting complex/Cyclosome and its activator Cdh1 [APC/C(Cdh1)] (Bashir et al, 2004; Wei et al, 2004).  The tight regulation of APC/C(Cdh1) activity ensures the timely  elimination Skp2 and, thus, plays a critical role in controlling the  G1/S transition. APC/C(Cdh1) becomes active in late M-phase by the  association of unphosphorylated Cdh1 with the APC/C. APC/C(Cdh1) remains active until the G1/S phase at which time it interacts with the  inhibitory protein, Emi1 (Hsu et al., 2002).  Inhibition of APC/C(Cdh1) activity results in an accumulation of cyclins, which leads to the  phosphorylation and consequently to a further inactivation of Cdh1 at G1/S (Lukas et al., 1999).  Finally, to make the inactivation of APC/C(Cdh1) permanent, Cdh1 and its E2, namely Ubc10, are eliminated in an auto-ubiquitination event (Listovsky  et al., 2004; Rape and Kirschner,  2004). At G1/S, Skp2 reaccumulates as Cdh1 is inactivated, thus allowing the ubiquitination of p21 and p27 and resulting in a further increase in CDK activity.''',

    179397: '''For retroviral DNA to direct production of progeny virions it must become covalently integrated into the host cell chromosome (reviewed in Coffin et al. 1997; Hansen et al. 1998). Analyses of mutants have identified the viral integrase coding region (part of the retroviral pol gene) as essential for the integration process (Donehower 1988; Donehower and Varmus 1984; Panganiban and Temin 1984; Quinn and Grandgenett 1988; Schwartzberg et al. 1984). Also essential are regions at the ends of the viral long terminal repeats (LTRs) that serve as recognition sites for integrase protein (Colicelli and Goff 1985, 1988; Panganiban and Temin 1983).<p>The viral genomic RNA is reverse transcribed to form a linear double-stranded DNA molecule, the precursor to the integrated provirus (Brown et al. 1987, 1989; Fujiwara and Mizuuchi 1988). The provirus is colinear with unintegrated linear viral DNA (Dhar et al. 1980; Hughes et al. 1978) but differs from the reverse transcription product in that it is missing two bases from each end (Hughes et al. 1981). Flanking the integrated HIV provirus are direct repeats of the cellular DNA that are 5 base pairs in length (Vincent et al. 1990). This duplication of cellular sequences flanking the viral DNA is generated as a consequence of the integration mechanism (Coffin et al., 1997). <p>Linear viral DNA is found in a complex with proteins in the cytoplasm of infected cells. These complexes (termed "preintegration complexes", PICs) can be isolated and have been shown to mediate integration of viral DNA into target DNA in vitro (Bowerman et al. 1989; Brown et al. 1987; Ellison et al. 1990; Farnet and Haseltine 1990, 1991). <p>The development of in vitro assays with purified integrase has allowed its enzymatic functions to be elucidated. The provirus is formed by two reactions catalyzed by the viral integrase: terminal cleavage and strand transfer. Studies with purified integrase have shown that it is sufficient for both 3' end cleavage (Bushman and Craigie 1991; Craigie et al. 1990; Katzman et al. 1989; Sherman and Fyfe 1990) and joining of the viral DNA to the cellular chromosome or naked target DNA (Bushman et al. 1990; Craigie et al. 1990; Katz et al. 1990). HIV integrase catalyze the removal of two bases from the 3' end of each viral DNA strand, leaving recessed 3' hydroxyl groups (Brown et al. 1989; Fujiwara and Mizuuchi 1988; Roth et al. 1989; Sherman and Fyfe 1990). This terminal cleavage reaction is required for proper integration. It may allow the virus to create a standard end from viral DNA termini that can be heterogeneous due to the terminal transferase activity of reverse transcriptase (Miller et al. 1997; Patel and Preston 1994). In addition, the terminal cleavage step is coupled to the formation of a stable integrase-DNA complex (Ellison and Brown 1994; Vink et al. 1994). Following terminal cleavage, a recessed hydroxyl is exposed that immediately follows a CA dinucleotide. More internal LTR sites are also important for integration (Balakrishnan and Jonsson 1997; Bushman and Craigie 1990; Leavitt et al. 1992). After end processing, integrase catalyzes the covalent attachment of hydroxyl groups at the viral DNA termini to protruding 5' phosphoryl ends of the host cell DNA (Brown et al. 1987; Brown et al. 1989; Fujiwara and Mizuuchi 1988). The DNA cleavage and joining reactions involved in integration are shown in the figure below. Both the viral DNA 3' end cleavage and strand transfer reactions are mediated by single-step transesterification chemistry as shown by stereochemical analysis of reaction products (Engelman et al. 1991). Biochemical analysis of purified integrase revealed that it requires a divalent metal - either Mg2+ or Mn2+ - to carry out reactions with model substrates, that probably mediate the reaction chemistry (Bushman and Craigie 1991; Craigie et al. 1990; Katzman et al. 1989; Sherman and Fyfe 1990; Gao et al. 2004).''',

Dolichol biosynthesis occurs on the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane, which is where N-glycosylation occurs too, so is perfectly placed to serve as a substrate for this process. Dolichyl phosphate can be obtained either from direct phosphorylation of dolichol, formed in a series of reactions from mevalonate 5-pyrophosphate, or a salvage reaction by de-phosphorylation of dolichyl diphosphate, released at the end of N-glycan biosynthesis (Cantagrel & Lefeber 2011).''',

    9026770: '''Resolution of inflammation is carried out by endogenous mediators termed specialised proresolving mediators (SPMs). Macrophages are central to the acute inflammatory response, governing both initiation and resolution phases, depending on the macrophage subtype activated. Human macrophages involved in resolution produce a family of bioactive peptide-conjugated mediators called maresin conjugates in tissue regeneration (MCTR). These mediators stimulate human phagocytotic functions, promote the resolution of bacterial infections, counterregulate the production of proinflammatory mediators and promote tissue repair and regeneration (Dalli et al. 2016). The proposed biosynthetic pathway is as follows. The maresin epoxide intermediate 13(S),14(S)-epoxy-MaR (13(S),14(S)-epoxy-docosahexaenoic acid) can be converted to MCTR1 (13(R)-glutathionyl, 14(S)-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid) by LTC4S and GSTM4. MCTR1 can be converted to MCTR2 (13(R)-cysteinylglycinyl, 14(S)-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid) by γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Finally, a dipeptidase can cleave the cysteinyl-glycinyl bond of MCTR2 to give MCTR3 (13(R)-cysteinyl, 14(S)-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid) (Dalli et al. 2016, Serhan et al. 2017).''',

    416983: '''Trafficking of GluR2-containing receptors is governed by protein protein interactions that are regulated by phosphorylation events. GluR2 binds NSF and AP2 in the proximal C terminal region and binds PICK and GRIP1/2 in the extreme C terminal region. GluR2 interaction with NSF is necessary to maintain the synaptic levels of GluR2-containing AMPA receptors both at basal levels and under conditions of  synaptic activity. GluR2 interaction with GRIP helps anchor AMPA receptors at the synapse. Phosphorylation of GluR2 at S880 disrupts GRIP interaction but allows binding of PICK. PICK is activated by Ca sensitive Protein kinase C (PKC). Under basal conditions, in hippocampal synapse, GluR2-containing AMPA receptors (GluR2/GluR3) constitutively recycle between the synapse and the endosome by endocytosis and exocytosis. GRIP anchors the receptors at the synapse while PICK interaction internalizes the receptors and NSF helps maintain the synaptic receptors. Cerebellar stellate cells mainly contain GluR3 homomers as Ca permeable receptors. The interaction of GluR3 and GRIP is disrupted by PICK interaction by phosphorylation of equivalent of S880 residue in GluR3.  Under conditions of repetitive presynaptic activity, there is PICK dependent removal of GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors and selective incorporation of GluR2-containing AMPA receptors at the synapse. The GluR2-containing AMPA receptors are first delivered to the surface by PICK and mobilized to the synapse by NSF dependent mechanism (Liu SJ and Cull-Candy SG Nat Neurosci. 2005 Jun;8(6):768-75)''',

CREB phosphorylation at serine 133 is a crucial event in neurotrophin signalling, being mediated by ERK/RSK, ERK/MSK1 and p38/MAPKAPK2 pathways. Several kinases, such as MSK1, RSK1/2/3 (MAPKAPK1A/B/C), and MAPKAPK2, are able to directly phosphorylate CREB at S133. MSK1 is also able to activate ATF (Cyclic-AMP-dependent transcription factor).

PDPK1 phosphorylates PKNs on a highly conserved threonine residue in the kinase activation loop, which is a prerequisite for PKN activation. Phosphorylation of other residues might also be involved in activation (Flynn et al. 2000, Torbett et al. 2003, Dettori et al. 2009). PKNs are activated by fatty acids like arachidonic acid and phospholipids in vitro, but the in vivo significance of this activation remains unclear (Palmer et al. 1995, Yoshinaga et al. 1999).<p>PKNs play important roles in diverse functions, including regulation of cell cycle, receptor trafficking, vesicle transport and apoptosis.

SAHF appear as compacted, punctate DAPI stained foci of DNA.

    171269: '''The TGF-beta/BMP pathway incorporates several signaling pathways that share most, but not all, components of a central signal transduction engine. The general signaling scheme is rather simple: upon binding of a ligand, an activated plasma membrane receptor complex is formed, which passes on the signal towards the nucleus through a phosphorylated receptor SMAD (R-SMAD). In the nucleus, the activated R-SMAD promotes transcription in complex with a closely related helper molecule termed Co-SMAD (SMAD4).

R-SMAD:Co-SMAD heterotrimer translocates to the nucleus where it directly binds DNA and, in cooperation with other transcription factors, regulates expression of genes involved in cell differentiation, in a context-dependent manner. <br>The intracellular level of SMAD2 and SMAD3 is regulated by SMURF ubiquitin ligases, which target R-SMADs for degradation. In addition, nuclear R-SMAD:Co-SMAD heterotrimer stimulates transcription of inhibitory SMADs (I-SMADs), forming a negative feedback loop. I-SMADs bind the phosphorylated TGF beta receptor complexes on caveolin coated vesicles, derived from the lipid rafts, and recruit SMURF ubiquitin ligases to TGF beta receptors, leading to ubiquitination and degradation of TGFBR1. Nuclear R-SMAD:Co-SMAD heterotrimers are targets of nuclear ubiquitin ligases which ubiquitinate SMAD2/3 and SMAD4, causing heterotrimer dissociation, translocation of ubiquitinated SMADs to the cytosol and their proteasome-mediated degradation.

    2190597: '''Binding of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1, i.e. TGFB1) to TGF beta receptor type 2 (TGFBR2) activates TGF beta receptor signaling cascade. TGFB1 is posttranslationally processed by furin (Dubois et al. 1995) to form a homodimer and secreted to the extracellular space as part of the large latent complex (LLC). After the LLC disassembles in the extracellular space, dimeric TGFB1 becomes capable of binding to TGFBR2 (Annes et al. 2003, Keski Oja et al. 2004). Formation of TGFB1:TGFBR2 complex creates a binding pocket for TGF-beta receptor type-1 (TGFBR1) and TGFBR1 is recruited to the complex by binding to both TGFB1 and TGFBR2. This results in an active heterotetrameric TGF-beta receptor complex that consists of TGFB1 homodimer bound to two heterodimers of TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 (Wrana et al. 1992, Moustakas et al. 1993, Franzen et al. 1993). TGF-beta signaling can also occur through a single heterodimer of TGFBR1 and TGFBR2, although with decreased efficiency (Huang et al. 2011). TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 interact through their extracellular domains, which brings their cytoplasmic domains together. Ligand binding to extracellular receptor domains is cooperative, but no conformational change is seen from crystal structures of either TGFB1- or TGFB3-bound heterotetrameric receptor complexes (Groppe et al. 2008, Radaev et al. 2010).<br><br>Activation of TGFBR1 by TGFBR2 in the absence of ligand is prevented by FKBP1A (FKBP12), a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase. FKBP1A forms a complex with inactive TGFBR1 and dissociates from it only after TGFBR1 is recruited by TGFB1-bound TGFBR2 (Chen et al. 1997). <br><br>Both TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 are receptor serine/threonine kinases. Formation of the hetero-tetrameric TGF-beta receptor complex (TGFBR) in response to TGFB1 binding induces receptor rotation, so that TGFBR2 and TGFBR1 cytoplasmic kinase domains face each other in a catalytically favourable configuration. TGFBR2 trans-phosphorylates serine residues at the conserved Gly-Ser-rich juxtapositioned domain (GS domain) of TGFBR1 (Wrana et al. 1994, Souchelnytskyi et al. 1996), activating TGFBR1.<br>In addition to phosphorylation, TGFBR1 may also be sumoylated in response to TGF-beta stimulation. Sumoylation enhances TGFBR1 kinase activity (Kang et al. 2008). <br><br>The activated TGFBR complex is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis into early endosomes. With the assistance of SARA, an early endosome membrane protein, phosphorylated TGFBR1 within TGFBR complex recruits SMAD2 and/or SMAD3 , i.e. R-SMADs (Tsukazaki et al. 1998). TGFBR1 phosphorylates recruited SMAD2/3 on two C-terminal serine residues (Souchelnytskyi et al. 2001). The phosphorylation changes the conformation of SMAD2/3 MH2 domain, promoting dissociation of SMAD2/3 from SARA and TGFBR1 (Souchelnytskyi et al. 1997, Macias-Silva et al. 1996, Nakao et al. 1997) and formation of SMAD2/3 trimers (Chacko et al. 2004). The phosphorylated C-terminal tail of SMAD2/3 has high affinity for SMAD4 (Co-SMAD), inducing formation of SMAD2/3:SMAD4 heterotrimers, composed of two phosphorylated R-SMADs (SMAD2 and/or SMAD3) and SMAD4 (Co-SMAD). SMAD2/3:SMAD4 heterotrimers are energetically favored over R-SMAD trimers (Nakao et al. 1997, Qin et al. 2001, Kawabata et al. 1998, Chacko et al. 2004). <br>SMAD2/3:SMAD4 heterotrimers translocate to the nucleus where they act as transcriptional regulators.

    2190603: '''TGF-beta receptor signaling is downregulated by proteasome and lysosome-mediated degradation of ubiquitinated TGFBR1, SMAD2 and SMAD3, as well as by dephosphorylation of TGFBR1, SMAD2 and SMAD3. <br><br>In the nucleus, SMAD2/3:SMAD4 complex stimulates transcription of SMAD7, an inhibitory SMAD (I-SMAD). SMAD7 binds phosphorylated TGFBR1 and competes with the binding of SMAD2 and SMAD3 (Hayashi et al. 1997, Nakao et al. 1997). Binding of SMAD7 to TGBR1 can be stabilized by STRAP, a protein that simultaneously binds SMAD7 and TGFBR1 (Datta et al. 2000). BAMBI simultaneously binds SMAD7 and activated TGFBR1, leading to downregulation of TGF-beta receptor complex signaling (Onichtchouk et al. 1999, Yan et al. 2009).<br> <br>In addition to competing with SMAD2/3 binding to TGFBR1, SMAD7 recruits protein phosphatase PP1 to phosphorylated TGFBR1, by binding to the PP1 regulatory subunit PPP1R15A (GADD34). PP1 dephosphorylates TGFBR1, preventing the activation of SMAD2/3 and propagation of TGF-beta signal (Shi et al. 2004). <br> <br>SMAD7 associates with several ubiquitin ligases, SMURF1 (Ebisawa et al. 2001, Suzuki et al. 2002, Tajima et al. 2003, Chong et al. 2010), SMURF2 (Kavsak et al. 2000, Ogunjimi et al. 2005), and NEDD4L (Kuratomi et al. 2005), and recruits them to phosphorylated TGFBR1 within TGFBR complex. SMURF1, SMURF2 and NEDD4L ubiquitinate TGFBR1 (and SMAD7), targeting TGFBR complex for proteasome and lysosome-dependent degradation (Ebisawa et al. 2001, Kavsak et al. 2000, Kuratomi et al. 2005). The ubiquitination of TGFBR1 can be reversed by deubiquitinating enzymes, UCHL5 (UCH37) and USP15, which may be recruited to ubiquitinated TGFBR1 by SMAD7 (Wicks et al. 2005, Eichhorn et al. 2012). <br> <br>Basal levels of SMAD2 and SMAD3 are maintained by SMURF2 and STUB1 ubiquitin ligases. SMURF2 is able to bind and ubiquitinate SMAD2, leading to SMAD2 degradation (Zhang et al. 2001), but this has been questioned by a recent study of Smurf2 knockout mice (Tang et al. 2011). STUB1 (CHIP) binds and ubiquitinates SMAD3, leading to SMAD3 degradation (Li et al. 2004, Xin et al. 2005). PMEPA1 can bind and sequester unphosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3, preventing their activation in response to TGF-beta signaling. In addition, PMEPA1 can bind and sequester phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3, preventing formation of SMAD2/3:SMAD4 heterotrimer complexes (Watanabe et al. 2010). A protein phosphatase MTMR4, residing in the membrane of early endosomes, can dephosphorylate activated SMAD2 and SMAD3, preventing formation of SMAD2/3:SMAD4 complexes (Yu et al. 2010). <br>''',

    912663: '''Cbl is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that negatively regulates signaling pathways by targeting proteins for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Rao et al. 2002). Cbl negatively regulates PI3K via this mechanism (Dufour et al. 2008). The binding of Cbl to the p85 subunit of PI3K is mediated at least in part by tyrosine phosphorylation at Y731 (Dufour et al. 2008). Fyn and the related kinases  Hck and Lyn are known to be associated with Cbl (Anderson et al. 1997, Hunter et al. 1999). Fyn is proven capable of Cbl Y731 phosphorylation (Hunter et al. 1999).The association of Fyn and Cbl has been described as constitutive (Hunter et al. 1999). CBL further associates with the p85 subunit of PI3K (Hartley et al. 1995, Anderson et al. 1997, Hunter et al. 1997), this also described as constitutive and mediated by the SH3 domain of p85. Binding of the SH2 domain of p85 to a specific phosphorylation site in Cbl is postulated to explain the the increase in Cbl/p85 association seen in activated cells (Panchamoorthy et al 1996) which negatively regulates PI3K activity (Fang et al. 2001). The negative effect of increased Cbl-PI3K interaction is mediated by Y731 of Cbl. Cbl binding increases PI3K ubiquitination and proteasome degradation (Dufour et al. 2008).<br><br><br>Cbl is constitutively associated with Grb in resting hematopoietic cells (Anderson et al. 1997, Odai et al. 1995, Park et al. 1998, Panchamoorthy et al. 1996).

The proximal domain binds Grb2 in resting and stimulated cells, and in stimulated cells also binds Shc. The distal domain binds the adaptor protein CRKL. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl in response to IL-3 releases the SH3 domain of Grb2 which then is free to bind other molecules (Park et al. 1998).

    2190615: '''After phosphorylated SMAD2 and/or SMAD3 form a heterotrimer with SMAD4, SMAD2/3:SMAD4 complex translocates to the nucleus (Xu et al. 2000, Kurisaki et al. 2001, Xiao et al. 2003). In the nucleus, linker regions of SMAD2 and SMAD3 within SMAD2/3:SMAD4 complex can be phosphorylated by CDK8 associated with cyclin C (CDK8:CCNC) or CDK9 associated with cyclin T (CDK9:CCNT). CDK8/CDK9-mediated phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 enhances transcriptional activity of SMAD2/3:SMAD4 complex, but also primes it for ubiquitination and consequent degradation (Alarcon et al. 2009). <br><br>The transfer of SMAD2/3:SMAD4 complex to the nucleus can be assisted by other proteins, such as WWTR1. In human embryonic cells, WWTR1 (TAZ) binds SMAD2/3:SMAD4 heterotrimer and mediates TGF-beta-dependent nuclear accumulation of SMAD2/3:SMAD4. The complex of WWTR1 and SMAD2/3:SMAD4 binds promoters of SMAD7 and SERPINE1 (PAI-1 i.e. plasminogen activator inhibitor 1) genes and stimulates their transcription (Varelas et al. 2008). Stimulation of SMAD7 transcription by SMAD2/3:SMAD4 represents a negative feedback loop in TGF-beta receptor signaling. SMAD7 can be downregulated by RNF111 ubiquitin ligase (Arkadia), which binds and ubiquitinates SMAD7, targeting it for degradation (Koinuma et al. 2003). <br><br>SMAD2/3:SMAD4 heterotrimer also binds the complex of RBL1 (p107), E2F4/5 and TFDP1/2 (DP1/2). The resulting complex binds MYC promoter and inhibits MYC transcription. Inhibition of MYC transcription contributes to anti-proliferative effect of TGF-beta (Chen et al. 2002). SMAD2/3:SMAD4 heterotrimer also associates with transcription factor SP1.

Higher levels of phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3, however, may target SKI and SKIL for degradation (Strochein et al. 1999, Sun et al. 1999 PNAS, Bonni et al. 2001) through recruitment of SMURF2 (Bonni et al. 2001) or RNF111 i.e. Arkadia (Levy et al. 2007) ubiquitin ligases to SKI/SKIL by SMAD2/3. Therefore,the ratio of SMAD2/3 and SKI/SKIL determines the outcome: inhibition of SMAD2/3:SMAD4-mediated transcription or degradation of SKI/SKIL.

Vitamin K is derived from green leafy vegetables as phylloquinone and is synthesized by gut flora as menaquinone-7.

    163103: '''Telomeres are protein-DNA complexes at the ends of linear chromosomes that are important for genome stability.  Telomeric DNA in humans, as in many eukaryotic organisms, consists of tandem repeats (Blackburn and Gall 1978; Moyzis et al. 1988; Meyne et al. 1989).  The repeats at human telomeres are composed of TTAGGG sequences and stretch for several kilobase pairs.  Another feature of telomeric DNA in many eukaryotes is a G-rich 3' single strand overhang, which in humans is estimated to be approximately 50-300 bases long (Makarov et al. 1997; Wright et al. 1997; Huffman et al. 2000).  Telomeric DNA isolated from humans and several other organisms can form a lasso-type structure called a t-loop in which the 3' single-strand end is presumed to invade the double stranded telomeric DNA repeat tract (Griffith et al. 1999).  Telomeric DNA is bound by multiple protein factors that play important roles in regulating telomere length and in protecting the chromosome end from recombination, non-homologous end-joining, DNA damage signaling, and unregulated nucleolytic attack (reviewed in de Lange 2005).  <br><br><br>DNA attrition can occur at telomeres, which can impact cell viability.  Attrition can occur owing to the "end-replication problem", a consequence of the mechanism of lagging-strand synthesis (Watson 1972; Olovnikov 1973).  Besides incomplete replication, nucleolytic processing also likely contributes to telomere attrition (Huffman et al. 2000).

Telomerase uses the RNA template to direct addition of multiple tandem repeats to the 3' G-rich single strand overhang.  Besides extension by telomerase, maintenance of telomeric DNA involves additional activities, including C-strand synthesis, which fills in the opposing strand, and nucleolytic processing, which likely contributes to the generation of the 3' overhang.<br>''',

    6798637: '''Human ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) contain about 200 residues that are enzymatically modified after transcription in the nucleolus (Maden and Khan 1977, Maden 1988, Maden and Hughes 1997, reviewed in Hernandez-Verdun et al. 2010, Boschi-Muller and Motorin 2013). The modified residues occur in regions of the rRNAs that are located in functionally important parts of the ribosome, notably in the A and P peptidyl transfer sites, the polypeptide exit tunnel, and intersubunit contacts (Polikanov et al. 2015, reviewed in Decatur and Fournier 2002, Chow et al. 2007, Sharma and Lafontaine 2015). The two most common modifications are pseudouridines and 2'-O-methylribonucleotides. Formation of pseudouridine from encoded uridine is catalyzed by box H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complexes (reviewed in Hamma and Ferre-D'Amare 2010, Watkins and Bohnsack 2011, Ge and Yu 2013, Kierzek et al. 2014, Yu and Meier 2014) and methylation of the hydroxyl group of the 2' carbon is catalyzed by box C/D snoRNPs (Kiss-Laszlo et al. 1996, Lapinaite et al. 2013, reviewed in Watkins and Bohnsack 2011). The snoRNP complexes contain common sets of protein subunits and unique snoRNAs that guide each complex to its target nucleotide of the rRNA by base-pairing between the snoRNA and the rRNA (reviewed in Henras et al. 2004, Watkins and Bohnsack 2011). Other modifications of rRNA include 5-methylcytidine (reviewed in Squires and Preiss 2010), 1-methylpseudouridine, 7-methylguanosine, 6-dimethyladenosine, and 4-acetylcytidine (reviewed in Sharma and Lafontaine 2015).

    392500: '''Metabolism of proteins, as annotated here, covers the full life cycle of a protein from its synthesis to its posttranslational modification and degradation, at various levels of specificity. Protein synthesis is accomplished through the process of Translation of an mRNA sequence into a polypeptide chain. Protein folding is achieved through the function of molecular chaperones which recognize and associate with proteins in their non-native state and facilitate their folding by stabilizing the conformation of productive folding intermediates (Young et al. 2004). Following translation, many newly formed proteins undergo Post-translational protein modification, essentially irreversible covalent modifications critical for their mature locations and functions (Knorre et al. 2009), including gamma carboxylation, synthesis of GPI-anchored proteins, asparagine N-linked glycosylation, O-glycosylation, SUMOylation, ubiquitination, deubiquitination, RAB geranylgeranylation, methylation, carboxyterminal post-translational modifications, neddylation, and phosphorylation. Peptide hormones are synthesized as parts of larger precursor proteins whose cleavage in the secretory system (endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, secretory granules) is annotated in Peptide hormone metabolism. After secretion, peptide hormones are modified and degraded by extracellular proteases (Chertow, 1981 PMID:6117463).  Two responses to protein damage are annotated in Reactome. The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is a regulatory system that protects the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) from overload. First, the UPR is provoked by the accumulation of improperly folded protein in the ER during times of unusually high secretory activity (Berridge, 2002). Second, protein repair enables the reversal of damage to some amino acid side chains caused by reactive oxygen species. Pulmonary surfactants are lipids and proteins that are secreted by the alveolar cells of the lung that decrease surface tension at the air/liquid interface within the alveoli to maintain the stability of pulmonary tissue (Agassandian and  Mallampalli 2013).  Nuclear regulation, transport, metabolism, reutilization, and degradation of surfactant are described in the Surfactant metabolism pathway. Amyloid fiber formation, the accumulation of mostly extracellular deposits of fibrillar proteins, is associated with tissue damage observed in numerous diseases including late phase heart failure (cardiomyopathy) and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's.''',

Adenosine nucleotides secreted following platelet activation signal through P2 purinergic receptors on the platelet membrane. ADP activates P2Y1 and P2Y12 while ATP activates the ionotropic P2X1 receptor (Kunapuli et al. 2003).

Furthermore, stimulation of IRAK1-deficient I1A 293 cells with LMP1 (latent membrane protein 1- a known viral activator of NF-kappa-B) leads to TRAF6 polyubiquitination and IKKbeta activation [Song et al 2006].

    5676383: '''Activation of NF-kB is fundamental to signal transduction by members of the TNFRSF.

Unlike NF-kB1 signalling, which can be activated by a wide variety of receptors, the NF-kB2 pathway is typically activated by a subset of receptor and ligand pairs belonging to the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF) super family (TNFRSF) members. These members include TNFR2 (Rauert et al. 2010), B cell activating factor of the TNF family receptor (BAFFR also known as TNFRSF13C) (Kayagaki et al. 2002, CD40 (also known as TNFRSF5) (Coope et al. 2002, lymphotoxin beta-receptor (LTBR also known as TNFRSF3) (Dejardin et al. 2002), receptor activator for nuclear factor kB (RANK also known as TNFRSF11A) (Novack et al. 2003), CD27 and Fibroblast growth factor-inducible immediate-early response protein 14 (FN14 also known as TNFRSF12A) etc. These receptors each mediate specific biological roles of the non-canonical NF-kB.

    6798697: '''Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes (white blood cells), indispensable in defending the body against invading microorganisms. In response to infection, neutrophils leave the circulation and migrate towards the inflammatory focus. They contain several subsets of granules that are mobilized to fuse with the cell membrane or phagosomal membrane, resulting in the exocytosis or exposure of membrane proteins. Traditionally, neutrophil granule constituents are described as antimicrobial or proteolytic, but granules also introduce membrane proteins to the cell surface, changing how the neutrophil responds to its environment (Borregaard et al. 2007). Primed neutrophils actively secrete cytokines and other inflammatory mediators and can present antigens via MHC II, stimulating T-cells (Wright et al. 2010).<br><br>Granules form during neutrophil differentiation.

    9018730: '''A host’s normal protective response to tissue injury or pathogenic infection is acute inflammation. The condition of acute inflammation is created by the release of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators such as leukotrienes (LTs) and prostaglandins (PGs) that launch a series of signaling cascades to destroy invading pathogens and to repair damaged tissue (Libby 2007). The potent chemotactic agent leukotriene B4 (LTB4) promotes the recruitment of neutrophils (PMNs) to inflamed tissues, while the prostaglandins E2 and D2 (PGE2 and PGD2) further accelerate the inflammatory process. If left unchecked, the inflammatory response can initiate chronic systemic inflammatory disorders associated with cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, periodontal disease, asthma, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Alzheimer’s disease and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The specific role by which inflammation contributes to their pathogenesis is not fully understood.<br><br>To prevent the onset of chronic inflammation, a <i>lipid mediator class switch</i> is thought to occur from the initial actions of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators to the anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions of lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins (collectively called specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs)). Nanopicogram quantities of different lipid mediators are generated at different times during the evolution of the inflammatory response and these mediators coincide with distinct cellular events. The class switch activates leukocyte translational regulation of the enzymes required to produce pro-resolving lipid mediators (Levy et al. 2001). Each family of these PSMs exert specialized actions, including blocking neutrophil recruitment, promoting the recruitment and activation of monocytes, as well as mediating the nonphlogistic phagocytosis and lymphatic clearance of apoptotic neutrophils by activated macrophages (ie without inducing inflammation) and mediating tissue regeneration. Eventually, through the combined actions of these mediators, the resolution of inflammation is completed and homeostasis is reached (Serhan 2010, Bannenberg & Serhan 2010, Freire & Van Dyke 2013, Serhan et al. 2014).<br><br>SPMs are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (Molfino et al. 2017). PUFAs of the ω-3 series are essential nutrients since they cannot be produced by humans (Duvall & Levy 2016) and are primarily found in dietary fish oils (Calder 2013) and in plants (Baker et al. 2016). The ω-3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPAn-3) circulate in the bloodstream after dietary intake and are easily incorporated into cellular membranes in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Calder 2009), as well as being present in inflammatory exudates (Kasuga et al. 2008). They can be mobilised by phospholipase A2 from cellular membranes on injury or infection when they are converted to exudate SPMs (Serhan et al. 2002) to interact with local immune cells (Kasuga et al. 2008). EPA is the source for E-series resolvins while DHA is the source for D-series resolvins, protectins, maresins and sulfido conjugates in tissue regeneration mediators (Serhan et al. 2017). The ω-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA) is the source for lipoxins. ω-3 or ω-6 PUFA docosapentaenoic acids (DPAn-3 and DPAn-6) are the sources of DPA-derived resolvins, protectins and maresins (Vik et al. 2017). Aspirin can also trigger the production of epimeric SPMs via acetylated PTGS2 (prostaglandin G/H synthase, COX2) (Serhan & Chiang 2002). Combinations of oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis can generate numerous SPMs. Electrophilic oxo-derivatives of ω-3 PUFAs are a class of oxidised derivatives that are generated in macrophages and neutrophils by the actions of 5-lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase-2 and acetylated cyclooxygenase-2, followed by dehydrogenation. Being electrophilic, oxo-derivative SPMs reversibly bind to nucleophilic residues on target proteins, triggering the activation of cytoprotective pathways (Cipollina 2015). The pathways in this section describe the biosynthesis of these SPMs.''',

Contraction in smooth muscle generally uses a variant of the same sliding filament model found in striated muscle, except in smooth muscle the actin and myosin filaments are anchored to focal adhesions, and dense bodies, spread over the surface of the smooth muscle cell. When actin and myosin move across one another focal adhesions are drawn towards dense bodies, effectively squeezing the cell into a smaller conformation. The sliding is triggered by calcium:caldesmon binding, caldesmon acting in an analogous fashion to troponin in striated muscle. Phosphorylation of myosin light chains also is involved in the initiation of an effective contraction.<br>

The functional form of these enzymes appears to be a complex of the two located on the Golgi membrane.

    163197: '''Mitochondria are often described as the "powerhouse" of a cell as it is here that energy is largely released from the oxidation of food. Reducing equivalents generated from beta-oxidation of fatty acids and from the Krebs cycle enter the electron transport chain (also called the respiratory chain). During a series of redox reactions, electrons travel down the chain releasing their energy in controlled steps. These reactions drive the active transport of protons from the mitochondrial matrix , through the inner membrane to the intermembrane space. The respiratory chain consists of five main types of carrier; flavins, iron-sulfur centres, quinones, cytochromes (heme proteins) and copper. The two main reducing equivalents entering the respiratory chain are NADH and FADH2. NADH is linked through the NADH-specific dehydrogenase whereas FADH2 is reoxidised within succinate dehydrogenase and a ubiquinone reductase of the fatty acid oxidation pathway. Oxygen is the final acceptor of electrons and with protons, is converted to form water, the end product of aerobic cellular respiration. A proton electrochemical gradient (often called protonmotive force) is established across the inner membrane, with positive charge in the intermembrane space relative to the matrix. Protons driven by the proton-motive force,  can enter ATP synthase thus returning to the mitochondrial matrix. ATP synthases use this exergonic flow to form ATP in the matrix, a process called chemiosmotic coupling. A by-product of this process is heat generation.<br><br>An antiport, ATP-ADP translocase, preferentially exports ATP from the matrix thereby maintaining a high ADP:ATP ratio in the matrix. The tight coupling of electron flow to ATP synthesis means oxygen consumption is dependent on ADP availability (termed respiratory control). High ADP (low ATP) increases electron flow thereby increasing oxygen consumption and low ADP (high ATP) decreases electron flow and thereby decreases oxygen consumption. There are many inhibitors of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Most act by either blocking the flow of electrons (eg cyanide, carbon monoxide, rotenone) or uncoupling electron flow from ATP synthesis (eg dinitrophenol). Thermogenin is a natural protein found in brown fat. Newborn babies have a large amount of brown fat and the heat generated by thermogenin is an alternative to ATP synthesis (and thus electron flow only produces heat) and allows the maintenance of body temperature in newborns.<br><br>The electron transport chain is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and comprises some 80 proteins organized in four enzymatic complexes (I-IV). Complex V generates ATP but has no electron transfer activity. In addition to these 5 complexes, there  are also two electron shuttle molecules; Coenzyme Q (also known as ubiquinone, CoQ) and Cytochrome c (Cytc). These two molecules shuttle electrons between the large complexes in the chain.<br><br>How many ATPs are generated by this process? Theoretically, for each glucose molecule, 32 ATPs can be produced. As electrons drop from NADH to oxygen in the chain, the number of protons pumped out and returning through ATP synthase can produce 2.5 ATPs per electron pair.  For each pair donated by FADH2, only 1.5 ATPs can be formed. Twelve pairs of electrons are removed from each glucose molecule;<br><br>10 by NAD+ = 25 ATPs<br>2 by FADH2 = 3 ATPs.<br><br>Making a total of 28 ATPs. However, 2 ATPs are formed during the Krebs' cycle and 2 ATPs formed during glycolysis for each glucose molecule therefore making a total ATP yield of 32 ATPs. In reality, the energy from the respiratory chain is used for other processes (such as active transport of important ions and molecules) so under conditions of normal respiration, the actual ATP yield probably does not reach 32 ATPs.<br><br>The reducing equivalents that fuel the electron transport chain, namely NADH and FADH2, are produced by the Krebs cycle (TCA cycle) and the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. At three steps in the Krebs cycle (isocitrate conversion to oxoglutarate; oxoglutarate conversion to succinyl-CoA; Malate conversion to oxaloacetate), a pair of electrons (2e-) are removed and transferred to NAD+, forming NADH and H+. At a single step, a pair of electrons are removed from succinate, reducing FAD to FADH2. From the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, one step in the process forms NADH and H+ and another step forms FADH2.<br><br>Cytoplasmic NADH, generated from glycolysis, has to be oxidized to reform NAD+, essential for glycolysis, otherwise glycolysis would cease to function. There is no carrier that transports NADH directly into the mitochondrial matrix and the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH so the cell uses two shuttle systems to move reducing equivalents into the mitochondrion and regenerate cytosolic NAD+. <br>The first is the glycerol phosphate shuttle, which uses electrons from cytosolic NADH to produce FADH2 within the inner membrane. These electrons then flow to Coenzyme Q. Complex I is bypassed so only 1.5 ATPs can be formed per NADH via this route. The overall balanced equation, summing all the reactions in this system, is<br><br>NADH (cytosol) + H+ (cytosol) + NAD+ (mito.) = NAD+ (cytosol) + NADH (mito.) + H+ (mito.)<br><br>The malate-aspartate shuttle uses the oxidation of malate to generate NADH in the mitochondrial matrix. This NADH can then be fed directly to complex I and thus can form 3 ATPs via the respiratory chain. The overall balanced equation is<br><br>NADH (cytosol) + H+ (cytosol) + FAD (inner memb.) = NAD+ (cytosol) + FADH2 (inner memb.)<br><br>Both of these shuttle systems regenerate cytosolic NAD+.<br><br>The entry point for NADH is complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) and the entry point for FADH2 is  Coenzyme Q.

    163226: '''Human mtDNA is transcribed by a dedicated mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT), which displays significant sequence similarity to the monomeric RNA polymerases found in bacteriophages. In contrast to the phage T7 RNA polymerase, POLRMT cannot interact with promoter DNA and initiate transcription on its own, but requires the presence of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), and either transcription factor B1 (TFB1M) or B2 (TFB2M). The 4 proteins of the basal mitochondrial transcription machinery have been purified in recombinant form and used to reconstitute transcription in vitro with a promoter containing DNA fragment (Falkenberg et al., 2002). Although both TFB1M and TFB2M can support in vitro transcription with POLRMT, TFB2M is at least two orders of magnitude more active than TFB1M and the physiological role of TFB1M in mitochondrial transcription has not yet been completely defined.

Human TFB1M is, in fact, a dual function protein, which not only support mitochondrial transcription in vitro, but also acts as a rRNA methyltransferase (Seidel-Rogol et al., 2003).

    8875420: '''Human cells have more than 60 RAB proteins that are involved in trafficking of proteins in the endolysosomal system. These small GTPases contribute to trafficking specificity by localizing to the membranes of different endocytic compartments and interacting with effectors such as sorting adaptors, tethering factors, kinases, phosphatases and tubular-vesicular cargo (reviewed in Stenmark et al, 2009; Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014). RAB localization depends on a number of factors including C-terminal prenylation, the sequence of an upstream hypervariable regions and what nucleotide is bound (Chavrier et al, 1991; Ullrich et al, 1993; Soldati et al, 1994; Farnsworth et al, 1994; Seabra, 1996; Wu et al, 2010; reviewed in Stenmark, 2009; Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014). In the active, GTP-bound form, prenylated RAB proteins are membrane associated, while in the inactive GDP-bound form, RABs are extracted from the target membrane and exist in a soluble form in complex with GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) (Ullrich et al, 1993; Soldati et al, 1994; Gavriljuk et al, 2103). Conversion between the inactive and active form relies on the activities of RAB guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) (Yoshimura et al, 2010; Wu et al, 2011; Pan et al, 2006; Frasa et al, 2012; reviewed in Stenmark, 2009; Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014).<br>Newly synthesized RABs are bound by a RAB escort protein, CHM (also known as REP1) or CHML (REP2) (Alexandrov et al, 1994; Shen and Seabra, 1996).

REP proteins recruit the unmodified RAB in its GDP-bound state to the GGTase for sequential geranylgeranylation at one or two C-terminal cysteine residues (Alexandrov et al, 1994; Seabra et al 1996; Shen and Seabra, 1996; Baron and Seabra, 2008). After geranylgeranylation, CHM/REP proteins remain in complex with the geranylgeranylated RAB and escort it to its target membrane, where its activity is regulated by GAPs, GEFs, GDIs and membrane-bound GDI displacement factors (GDFs) (Sivars et al, 2003; reviewed in Stenmark, 2009; Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014).''',
    5672351: '''Formins are a family of proteins with 15 members in mammals, organized into 8 subfamilies. Formins are involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Many but not all formin family members are activated by RHO GTPases. Formins that serve as effectors of RHO GTPases belong to different formin subfamilies but they all share a structural similarity to Drosophila protein diaphanous and are hence named diaphanous-related formins (DRFs).<p>DRFs activated by RHO GTPases contain a GTPase binding domain (GBD) at their N-terminus, followed by formin homology domains 3, 1, and 2 (FH3, FH1, FH2) and a diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD) at the C-terminus. Most DRFs contain a dimerization domain (DD) and a coiled-coil region (CC) in between FH3 and FH1 domains (reviewed by Kuhn and Geyer 2014). RHO GTPase-activated DRFs are autoinhibited through the interaction between FH3 and DAD which is disrupted upon binding to an active RHO GTPase (Li and Higgs 2003, Lammers et al. 2005, Nezami et al. 2006). Since formins dimerize, it is not clear whether the FH3-DAD interaction is intra- or intermolecular. FH2 domain is responsible for binding to the F-actin and contributes to the formation of head-to-tail formin dimers (Xu et al. 2004). The proline-rich FH1 domain interacts with the actin-binding proteins profilins, thereby facilitating actin recruitment to formins and accelerating actin polymerization (Romero et al. 2004, Kovar et al. 2006).<p>Different formins are activated by different RHO GTPases in different cell contexts.

Activation of FMNL1 by CDC42:GTP contributes to the formation of the phagocytic cup (Seth et al. 2006). Activation of FMNL2 (formin-like protein 2) and FMNL3 (formin-like protein 3) by RHOC:GTP is involved in cancer cell motility and invasiveness (Kitzing et al. 2010, Vega et al. 2011). DIAPH1, activated by RHOA:GTP, promotes elongation of actin filaments and activation of SRF-mediated transcription which is inhibited by unpolymerized actin (Miralles et al. 2003). RHOF-mediated activation of DIAPH1 is implicated in formation of stress fibers (Fan et al. 2010). Activation of DIAPH1 and DIAPH3 by RHOB:GTP leads to actin coat formation around endosomes and regulates endosome motility and trafficking (Fernandez-Borja et al. 2005, Wallar et al. 2007). Endosome trafficking is also regulated by DIAPH2 transcription isoform 3 (DIAPH2-3) which, upon activation by RHOD:GTP, recruits SRC kinase to endosomes (Tominaga et al. 2000, Gasman et al. 2003). DIAPH2 transcription isoform 2 (DIAPH2-2) is involved in mitosis where, upon being activated by CDC42:GTP, it facilitates the capture of astral microtubules by kinetochores (Yasuda et al. 2004, Cheng et al. 2011).

The double-stranded mitochondrial genome lacks introns and the longer non-coding region contains the control elements for transcription and replication of mtDNA  (Shadel and Clayton,  1997).   The two mtDNA strands are referred to as the heavy  (H-strand) and the light  (L-strand) due to their differing  G+T content.

Desjardins  proposed that ER is recruited to the cell surface, where it fuses with the plasma membrane, underneath phagocytic cups, to supply membrane for the formation of nascent phagosomes (Gagnon et al. 2002). Three independent studies simultaneously showed that ER contributes to the vast majority of phagosome membrane (Guermonprez et al. 2003, Houde et al. 2003, Ackerman et al. 2003). The composition of early phagosome membrane contains ER-resident proteins, the components required for cross-presentation. This model is similar to the phagosome-to-cytosol model in that Ag is translocated to cytosol for proteasomal degradation, but differs in that antigenic peptides are translocated back into the phagosome (instead of ER) for peptide:MHC-I complexes. ER fusion with phagosome introduces molecules that are involved in Ag transport to cytosol (Sec61) and proteasome-generated peptides back into the phagosome (TAP) for loading onto MHC-I. <br>Although the ER-phagosome pathway is controversial, the concept remains attractive as it explains how peptide-receptive MHC-I molecules could intersect with a relatively high concentration of exogenous antigens, presumably a crucial prerequisite for efficient cross-presentation (Basha et al. 2008).''',

    5672377: '''WASP and WAVE proteins belong to the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein family, with recessive mutations in the founding member WASP being responsible for the X-linked recessive immunodeficieny known as the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome. WASP proteins include WASP and WASL (N-WASP). WAVE proteins include WASF1 (WAVE1), WASF2 (WAVE2) and WASF3 (WAVE3). WASPs and WAVEs contain a VCA domain (consisting of WH2 and CA subdomains) at the C-terminus, responsible for binding to G-actin (WH2 subdomain) and the actin-associated ARP2/3 complex (CA subdomain). WASPs contain a WH1 (WASP homology 1) domain at the N-terminus, responsible for binding to WIPs (WASP-interacting proteins). A RHO GTPase binding domain (GBD) is located in the N-terminal half of WASPs and C-terminally located in WAVEs. RHO GTPases activate WASPs by disrupting the autoinhibitory interaction between the GBD and VCA domains, which allows WASPs to bind actin and the ARP2/3 complex and act as nucleation promoting factors in actin polymerization. WAVEs have the WAVE/SCAR homology domain (WHD/SHD) at the N-terminus, which binds ABI, NCKAP1, CYFIP2 and BRK1 to form the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC). Binding of the RAC1:GTP to the GBD of WAVEs most likely induces a conformational change in the WRC that allows activating phosphorylation of WAVEs by ABL1, thus enabling them to function as nucleation promoting factors in actin polymerization through binding G-actin and the ARP2/3 complex (Reviewed by Lane et al. 2014).''',

Hepoxilin A3 (HXA3) and B3 (HXB3) have been identified, both of which incorporate an epoxide across the C-11 and C-12 double bond, as well as an additional hydroxyl moiety.  HXA3 has a C-8 hydroxyl, whereas the HXB3 hydroxyl occurs at C-10. The epoxy moiety is labile and can be hydrolyzed either by a hepoxilin specific epoxide hydrolase (HXEH) or in acidic aqueous solution to form the corresponding diol metabolites trioxilin A3 (TrXA3) and B3 (TrXB3) (Buczynski et al. 2009, Vance & Vance 2008).''',
    163261: '''Transcription of the heavy (H)-strand of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) involves two overlapping transcription units  (Montoyaet al.,1982; Montoya et al., 1983). The first unit starts right upstream of the tRNAPhe gene and spans the tRNAPhe, rRNA 12S, rRNA 16S and tRNAVal genes (initiation site IH1). The other starts about 100 bp further downstream (initiation site IH2), at the boundary between tRNAPhe and rRNA12S genes, and produces a single polycistronic RNA that encompasses almost the entire length of the H-strand. The ribosomal transcription unit is transcribed at a much higher rate compared to the other transcription unit and control of its expression is exerted both at the level of initiation and termination (Gelfand and Attardi, 1981; Attardi et al., 1990). A central role in the control of termination has been attributed to the mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF), a 39-kDa protein that binds to a 28-base pair region of mtDNA located within the tRNALeu(UUR) gene, at a position immediately downstream of the rRNA 16S gene  (Fernandez-Silva et al.,1997; Kruse et al., 1989).''',

Prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) is the starting point for the synthesis of Thromboxanes (TXs) (Buczynski et al. 2009, Vance & Vance 2008). PGs and TXs are collectively known as the prostanoids.<br>Two enzymes, PTGS1 and 2 (COX1 and 2) both catalyze the two-step conversion of arachidonic acid to PGH2. PTGS1 is constitutively expressed in many cell types while PTGS2 is induced in response to stress and mediates the syntheses of prostaglandins associated with pain, fever, and inflammation. Aspirin irreversibly inactivates both enzymes (though it acts more efficiently on PTGS1), explaining both its antiinflammatory effects and side effects like perturbed gastic acid secretion. Drugs like celecoxib, by specifically inhibiting PTGS2, have a strong anti-inflammatory effect with fewer side effects. These PTGS2-specific drugs, however, probably because of their effects on the balance of prostaglandin synthesis in platelets and endothelial cells, can also promote blood clot formation (Buczynski et al. 2009; Stables & Gilroy 2011).''',
    880062: '''The two stereoisomers of 2-hydroxyglutarate are normally converted to 2-oxoglutarate in the mitochondrial matrix, and can then be metabolized by the citric acid cycle. The physiological sources of 2-hydroxyglutarate have not been established although plausible hypotheses are that it is generated by lysine breakdown or as a byproduct of delta-aminolevulinate metabolism. The stereoisomers are oxidized to 2-oxoglutarate in FAD-dependent reactions catalyzed by the enzymes D2HGDH (specific for R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate) and L2HGDH (specific for S(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate). An inherited deficiency in either enzyme is associated with accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate and variable neurological symptoms. R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate also reacts reversibly with succinate semialdehyde to form 4-hydroxybutyrate and 2-oxoglutarate, catalyzed by ADHFE1. No deficiencies of this enzyme have been found in patients with elevated 2-hydroxyglutarate levels (Struys 2006).''',
    8936896: '''Steroid hormone receptors (SHR) are transcription factors that become activated upon sensing steroid hormones such as glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, progesterone, androgens, or estrogen (Escriva et al 2000; Griekspoor A et al. 2007; Eick GN & Thornton JW. 2011). Depending on SHR type and the presence of ligand, they show different subcellular localizations. Whereas both unliganded and liganded estrogen receptors (ERalpha and ERbeta) are predominantly nuclear, unliganded glucocorticoid (GR) and androgen receptors (AR) are mostly located in the cytoplasm and completely translocate to the nucleus only after binding hormone (Htun H et al. 1999; Stenoien D et al. 2000; Tyagi RK et al. 2000; Cadepond F et al. 1992; Jewell CM et al. 1995; Kumar S et al. 2006). The unliganded mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is partially cytoplasmic but can be found in nucleus in the ligand-bound or ligand-free form (Nishi M & Kawata M 2007). The progesterone receptor (PR) exists in two forms (PRA and PRB) with different ratios of nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization of the unliganded receptor. In most cell contexts, the PRA isoform is a repressor of the shorter PRB isoform, and without hormone induction it is mostly located in the nucleus, whereas PRB distributes both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (Lim CS et al. 1999; Griekspoor A et al. 2007). In the absence of ligand, members of the steroid receptor family remain sequestered in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus in the complex with proteins of HSP70/HSP90 chaperone machinery (Pratt WB & Dittmar KD1998). The highly dynamic ATP-dependent interactions of SHRs with HSP90 complexes regulate SHR cellular location, protein stability, competency to bind steroid hormones and transcriptional activity (Echeverria PC & Picard D 2010). Understanding the mechanism of ATPase activity of HSP90 is mostly based on structural and functional studies of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp90 complexes (Meyer P et al. 2003, 2004; Ali MM et al. 2006; Prodromou C et al. 2000; Prodromou C 2012). The ATPase cycle of human HSP90 is less well understood, however several studies suggest that the underlying enzymatic mechanisms and a set of conformational changes that accompany the ATPase cycle are highly similar in both species (Richter K et al. 2008; Vaughan CK et al. 2009). Nascent SHR proteins are chaperoned by HSP70 and HSP40 to HSP90 cycle via STIP1 (HOP) (and its TPR domains) (Hernández MP et al. 2002a,b; EcheverriaPC & Picard D 2010; Li J et al. 2011). The ATP-bound form of HSP90 leads to the displacement of STIP1 by immunophilins FKBP5 or FKBP4 resulting in conformational changes that allow efficient hormone binding (Li J et al. 2011). PTGES3 (p23) binds to HSP90 complex finally stabilizing it in the conformation with a high hormone binding affinity. After hydrolysis of ATP the hormone bound SHR is released from HSP90 complex. The cytosolic hormone-bound SHR can be transported to the nucleus by several import pathways such as the dynein-based nuclear transport along microtubules involving the transport of the entire HSP90 complex or nuclear localization signals (NLS)-mediated nuclear targeting by importins (Tyagi RK et al. 2000; Cadepond F et al. 1992; Jewell CM et al. 1995; Kumar S et al. 2006). It is worth noting that GR-importin interactions can be ligand-dependent or independent (Freedman & Yamamoto 2004; Picard & Yamamoto 1987). In the nucleus ligand-activated SHR dimerizes, binds specific sequences in the DNA, called Hormone Responsive Elements (HRE), and recruits a number of coregulators that facilitate gene transcription. Nuclear localization is essential for SHRs to transactivate their target genes, but the same receptors also possess non-genomic functions in the cytoplasm.<p>The Reactome module describes the ATPase-driven conformational cycle of HSP90 that regulates ligand-dependent activation of SHRs.''',

LTs are derived from arachidonic acid through action by arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5).  Cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4) are generated as products derived from leukotriene A4 (LTA4).  Eoxins are generated from leukotrienes (LTs) and resemble cysteinyl leukotrienes but have a different three-dimensional structure (Murphy & Gijon 2007, Hammarstrom 1983, MA.Claesson 2009, Vance & Vance 2008, Buczynski et al. 2009).''',

    212450: '''<b>OVERVIEW OF TRANSCRIPTION REGULATION:</b>  <br><br>Detailed studies of gene transcription regulation in a wide variety of eukaryotic systems has revealed the general principles and mechanisms by which cell- or tissue-specific regulation of differential gene transcription is mediated (reviewed in Naar, 2001. Kadonaga, 2004, Maston, 2006, Barolo, 2002; Roeder, 2005, Rosenfeld, 2006).  Of the three major classes of DNA polymerase involved in eukaryotic gene transcription, Polymerase II generally regulates protein-encoding genes.   Figure 1 shows a diagram of the various components involved in cell-specific regulation of Pol-II gene transcription. <br><br>Core Promoter: Pol II-regulated genes typically have a Core Promoter where Pol II and a variety of general factors bind to specific DNA motifs: <br>   i: the TATA box (TATA DNA sequence), which is bound by the "TATA-binding protein" (TBP).<br>   ii: the Initiator motif (INR), where Pol II and certain other core factors bind, is present in many Pol II-regulated genes.<br>   iii: the Downstream Promoter Element (DPE), which is present in a subset of Pol II genes, and where additional core factors bind.  <br>The core promoter binding factors are generally ubiquitously expressed, although there are exceptions to this.<br><br>Proximal Promoter: immediately upstream (5') of the core promoter, Pol II target genes often have a Proximal Promoter region that spans up to 500 base pairs (b.p.), or even to 1000 b.p..  This region contains a number of functional DNA binding sites for a specific set of transcription activator (TA) and transcription repressor (TR) proteins.  These TA and TR factors are generally cell- or tissue-specific in expression, rather than ubiquitous, so that the presence of their cognate binding sites in the proximal promoter region programs cell- or tissue-specific expression of the target gene, perhaps in conjunction with TA and TR complexes bound in distal enhancer regions.  <br><br>Distal Enhancer(s): many or most Pol II regulated genes in higher eukaryotes have one or more distal Enhancer regions which are essential for proper regulation of the gene, often in a cell or tissue-specific pattern.  Like the proximal promoter region, each of the distal enhancer regions typically contain a cluster of binding sites for specific TA and/or TR DNA-binding factors, rather than just a single site. <br><br>   Enhancers generally have three defining characteristics:<br>     i: They can be located very long distances from the promoter of the target gene they regulate, sometimes as far as 100 Kb, or more.<br>     ii: They can be either upstream (5') or downstream (3') of the target gene, including within introns of that gene.<br>     iii: They can function in either orientation in the DNA.<br><br>Combinatorial mechanisms of transcription regulation: The specific combination of TA and TR binding sites within the proximal promoter and/or distal enhancer(s) provides a "combinatorial transcription code" that mediates cell- or tissue-specific expression of the associated target gene.  Each promoter or enhancer region mediates expression in a specific subset of the overall expression pattern.  In at least some cases, each enhancer region functions completely independently of the others, so that the overall expression pattern is a linear combination of the expression patterns of each of the enhancer modules.<br><br>Co-Activator and Co-Repressor Complexes:  DNA-bound TA and TR proteins typically recruit the assembly of specific Co-Activator (Co-A) and Co-Repressor (Co-R) Complexes, respectively, which are essential for regulating target gene transcription.  Both Co-A's and Co-R's  are multi-protein complexes that contain several specific protein components.<br><br>Co-Activator complexes generally contain at lease one component protein that has Histone Acetyl Transferase (HAT) enzymatic activity.  This functions to acetylate Histones and/or other chromatin-associated factors, which typically increases that transcription activation of the target gene.  By contrast, Co-Repressor complexes generally contain at lease one component protein that has Histone De-Acetylase (HDAC) enzymatic activity.  This functions to de-acetylate Histones and/or other chromatin-associated factors. This typically increases the transcription repression of the target gene.<br><br>Adaptor (Mediator) complexes: In addition to the co-activator complexes that assemble on particular cell-specific TA factors,  - there are at least two additional transcriptional co-activator complexes common to most cells.  One of these is the Mediator complex, which functions as an "adaptor" complex that bridges between the tissue-specific co-activator complexes assembled in the proximal promoter (or distal enhancers).  The human Mediator complex has been shown to contain at least 19 protein distinct components.  Different combinations of these co-activator proteins are also found to be components of specific transcription Co-Activator complexes, such as the DRIP, TRAP and ARC complexes described below.  <br><br>TBP/TAF complex: Another large Co-A complex is the "TBP-associated factors" (TAFs) that assemble on TBP (TATA-Binding Protein), which is bound to the TATA box present in many promoters.  There are at least 23 human TAF proteins that have been identified.  Many of these are ubiquitously expressed, but TAFs can also be expressed in a cell or tissue-specific pattern.  <br><br>


<b>	Specific Coactivator Complexes for DNA-binding Transcription Factors.</b>   <br><br>A number of specific co-activator complexes for DNA-binding transcription factors have been identified, including DRIP, TRAP, and ARC (reviewed in Bourbon, 2004, Blazek, 2005, Conaway, 2005, and Malik, 2005).  The DRIP co-activator complex was originally identified and named as a specific complex associated with the Vitamin D Receptor member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors (Rachez, 1998).  Similarly, the TRAP co-activator complex was originally identified as a complex that associates with the thyroid receptor (Yuan, 1998).   It was later determined that all of the components of the DRIP complex are also present in the TRAP complex, and the ARC complex (discussed further below).  For example, the DRIP205 and TRAP220 proteins were show to be identical, as were specific pairs of the other components of these complexes (Rachez, 1999).<br><br>In addition, these various transcription co-activator proteins identified in mammalian cells were found to be the orthologues or homologues of the Mediator ("adaptor") complex proteins (reviewed in Bourbon, 2004).  The Mediator proteins were originally identified in yeast  by Kornberg and colleagues, as complexes associated with DNA polymerase (Kelleher, 1990).  In higher organisms, Adapter complexes bridge between the basal transcription factors (including Pol II) and tissue-specific transcription factors (TFs) bound to sites within upstream Proximal Promoter regions or distal Enhancer regions (Figure 1).  However, many of the Mediator homologues can also be found in complexes associated with specific transcription factors in higher organisms.  A unified nomenclature system for these adapter / co-activator proteins now labels them Mediator 1 through Mediator 31 (Bourbon, 2004).  For example, the DRIP205 / TRAP220 proteins are now identified as Mediator 1 (Rachez, 1999), based on homology with yeast Mediator 1.<br><br>



<b>Example Pathway: Specific Regulation of Target Genes During Notch Signaling:</b> <br><br>One well-studied example of cell-specific regulation of gene transcription is selective regulation of target genes during Notch signaling.  Notch signaling was first identified in Drosophila, where it has been studied in detail at the genetic, molecular, biochemical and cellular levels (reviewed in Justice, 2002; Bray, 2006; Schweisguth, 2004; Louvri, 2006).  In Drosophila, Notch signaling to the nucleus is thought always to be mediated by one specific DNA binding transcription factor, Suppressor of Hairless.  In mammals, the homologous genes are called CBF1 (or RBPJkappa), while in worms they are called Lag-1, so that the acronym "CSL" has been given to this conserved transcription factor family.  There are at least two human CSL homologues, which are now named RBPJ and RBPJL.  <br><br>In Drosophila, Su(H) is known to be bifunctional, in that it represses target gene transcription in the absence of Notch signaling, but activates target genes during Notch signaling.  At least some of the mammalian CSL homologues are believed also to be bifunctional, and to mediate target gene repression in the absence of Notch signaling, and activation in the presence of Notch signaling.<br><br>Notch Co-Activator and Co-Repressor complexes: This repression is mediated by at least one specific co-repressor complexes (Co-R) bound to CSL in the absence of Notch signaling.  In Drosophila, this co-repressor complex consists of at least three distinct co-repressor proteins: Hairless, Groucho, and dCtBP (Drosophila C-terminal Binding Protein).  Hairless has been show to bind directly to Su(H), and Groucho and dCtBP have been shown to bind directly to Hairless (Barolo, 2002).  All three of the co-repressor proteins have been shown to be necessary for proper gene regulation during Notch signaling in vivo (Nagel, 2005).<br><br>In mammals, the same general pathway and mechanisms are observed, where CSL proteins are bifunctional DNA binding transcription factors (TFs), that bind to Co-Repressor complexes to mediate repression in the absence of Notch signaling, and bind to Co-Activator  complexes to mediate activation in the presence of Notch signaling.  However, in mammals, there may be multiple co-repressor complexes, rather than the single Hairless co-repressor complex that has been observed in Drosophila.  <br><br>During Notch signaling in all systems, the Notch transmembrane receptor is cleaved and the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) translocates to the nucleus, where it there functions as a specific transcription co-activator for CSL proteins.  In the nucleus, NICD replaces the Co-R complex bound to CSL, thus resulting in de-repression of  Notch target genes in the nucleus (Figure 2).  Once bound to CSL, NICD and CSL proteins recruit an additional co-activator protein, Mastermind, to form a CSL-NICD-Mam ternary co-activator (Co-A) complex.  This Co-R  complex was initially thought to be sufficient to mediate activation of  at least some Notch target genes.  However, there now is evidence that still other co-activators and additional DNA-binding transcription factors are required in at least some contexts (reviewed in Barolo, 2002).  <br><br>Thus, CSL is a good example of a bifunctional DNA-binding transcription factor that mediates repression of specific targets genes in one context, but activation of the same targets in another context.  This bifunctionality is mediated by the association of specific Co-Repressor complexes vs. specific Co-Activator complexes in different contexts, namely in the absence or presence of Notch signaling.''',
    3214819: '''Lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and arginine methyltransferases (RMTs) have a common mechanism of catalysis. Both families transfer a methyl group from a common donor, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), to the nitrogen atom on the epsilon-amino group of lysine or arginine (Smith & Denu 2009)  using a bimolecular nucleophillic substitution (SN2) methyl transfer mechanism (Smith & Denu 2009, Zhang & Bruice 2008). All human KMTs except DOT1L (KMT4) (Feng et al. 2002, van Leeuwen et al. 2002, Lacoste et al. 2002) have a ~130 amino acid catalytic domain referred to as the SET domain (Del Rizzo & Trievel 2011, Dillon et al. 2005, Herz et al. 2013). <br><br>Some KMTs selectively methylate a particular lysine residue on a specific histone type. The extent of this methylation (mono-, di- or tri-methylation) also can be stringent (Herz et al. 2013, Copeland et al. 2009). Many KMTs also have non-histone substrates (Herz et al 2013), which are not discussed in this module.<br><br>The coordinates of post-translational modifications represented and described here follow UniProt standard practice whereby coordinates refer to the translated protein before any processing.

First to be discovered were the SUV39 family named after founding member SUV39H1 (KMT1A), which selectively methylates lysine-10 of histone H3 (H3K9) (Rea et al. 2000). Family member EHMT2 (KMT1C, G9A) is the predominant H3K9 methyltransferase in mammals (Tachibana et al. 2002). SETDB1 (KMT1E, ESET) also predominantly methylates H3K9, most effectively when complexed with ATF7IP (MCAF, hAM) (Wang et al. 2003). <br><br>SETD2 (KMT3A, HYPB), a member of the SET2 family, specifically methylates histone H3 lysine-37 (H3K36) (Sun et al. 2005). WHSC1 (KMT3G, NSD2, MMSET) a member of the same family, targets H3K36 when provided with nucleosome substrates but also can methylate histone H4 lysine-45 when  octameric native or recombinant nucleosome substrates are provided (Li et al. 2009); dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine-37 (H3K36me2) is thought to be the principal chromatin-regulatory activity of WHSC1 (Kuo et al. 2011). Relatives NSD1 (KMT3B) and WHSC1L1 (KMT3F, NSD3) also methylate nucleosomal H3K36. NSD1 is active on unmethylated or a mimetic monomethylated H3K36, but not di- or trimethylated H3K36 mimetics (Li et al. 2009). Human SETD7 (KMT7, SET7/9), not classified within the 7 SET-domain containing families, mono-methylates lysine-5 of histone H3 (H3K4) (Xiao et al. 2003).''',

The third hydroxyl of LXA4 is positioned at C-6, and of LXB4 at C-14.  The action of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), in concert with an arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12) or arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15) activity, has been shown to produce lipoxins by three distinct pathways.  Neutrophil ALOX5 can produce and secrete leukotriene A4 (LTA4) that is taken up by platelets, where it is acted upon by ALOX12 to form lipoxins. Likewise, ALOX15s can generate either 15-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HpETE) or 15-hydro-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) that can be taken up by monocytes and neutrophils, where highly expressed ALOX5 uses it to generate lipoxins. Finally, aspirin acetylated prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (PTGS2), rendered unable to synthesize prostaglandins, can act as a 15-lipoxygenase. This leads to the formation of 15R-HETE and culminates in creation of epi-lipoxins, which have altered stereochemistry at the C-15 hydroxyl but similar biological potency (Chiang et al. 2006, Buczynski et al. 2009, Vance & Vance 2008, Stsiapanava et al. 2017).''',

After the Pol alpha-primase primase complex is displaced from the primer, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) binds to form a "sliding clamp" structure.

    1236465: '''MHC class I molecules generally present peptide antigens derived from proteins synthesized by the cell itself to CD8+ T cells. However, in some circumstances, antigens from extracellular environment can be presented on MHC class I to stimulate CD8+ T cell immunity, a process termed cross-presentation (Rock & Shen. 2005). Cross-presentation/cross-priming is the ability of antigen presenting cells (APCs) to present exogenous antigens on MHC class I molecules to CD8+ T lymphocytes. Among all the APCs, Dendritic cells (DC) are the dominant antigen cross presenting cell types in vivo, although macrophages and B cells appear to cross present model antigens in vitro with a low degree of efficiency (Amigorena & Savina. 2010, Ackermann & Peter Cresswell. 2004). Compared to macrophages, DCs have low levels of lysosomal proteases and exhibit limited lysosomal degradation (Delamarre et al. 2005). This limited proteolysis of internalized antigens by DCs might contribute to their high efficiency for cross presentation (Monua & Trombetta. 2007). APCs acquire the exogenous antigens through endocytic mechanisms, especially phagosomes for particulate/cell-associated antigens and endosomes for soluble protein antigens. There does not seem to be a unique pathway for cross-presentation but rather different potential mechanisms of cross-presentation have been proposed. These proposed pathways can be classified according to the location where two key events occur: 1) processing of the antigenic protein and 2)  loading of the processed peptide on to MHC I molecule (Blanchard & Shastri. 2010). Based on the requirement for TAP and cytosolic proteases two mechanisms have been described, a cytosolic pathway (TAP-dependent and proteasome-dependent) or a vacuolar pathway (TAP- and proteasome-independent) (Blanchard & Shastri. 2010, Amigorena & Savina. 2010). Regarding peptide-loading, MHC I could be loaded in the ER or in the phagosome and recycled to cell surface (Blanchard & Shastri. 2010).  Exogenous soluble antigens are cross-presented by dendritic cells, albeit with lower efficiency than for particulate substrates. Soluble antigens destined for cross-presentation are taken up by distinct endocytosis mechanisms which route them into stable early endosomes and then to the cytoplasm for proteasomal degradation and peptide loading. The outcome of the cross presentation can be either tolerance or immunity (Rock & Shen. 2005).''',
    77298: '''Beta-oxidation begins once fatty acids have been imported into the mitochondrial matrix by carnitine acyltransferases. The beta-oxidation spiral of fatty acids metabolism involves the repetitive removal of two carbon units from the fatty acyl chain. There are four steps to this process: oxidation, hydration, a second oxidation, and finally thiolysis. The last step releases the two-carbon acetyl-CoA and a ready primed acyl-CoA that takes another turn down the spiral. In total each turn of the beta-oxidation spiral produces one NADH, one FADH2, and one acetyl-CoA.<p>Further oxidation of acetyl-CoA via the tricarboxylic acid cycle generates additional FADH2 and NADH. All reduced cofactors are used by the mitochondrial electron transport chain to form ATP. The complete oxidation of a fatty acid molecule produces numerous ATP molecules. Palmitate, used as the model here, produces 129 ATPs.<p>Beta-oxidation pathways differ for saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.

Bile salt synthesis can also begin with the synthesis of an oxysterol - 24-hydroxycholesterol or 27-hydroxycholesterol. In the body, the initial steps of these two pathways occur in extrahepatic tissues, generating intermediates that are transported to the liver and converted to bile salts via the 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol pathway.

    2219521: '''Class IA PI3K is a heterodimer of a p85 regulatory subunit (encoded by PIK3R1, PIK3R2 or PIK3R3) and a p110 catalytic subunit (encoded by PIK3CA, PIK3CB or PIK3CD). In the absence of activating signals, the regulatory subunit stabilizes the catalytic subunit while inhibiting its activity. The complex becomes activated when extracellular signals stimulate the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane receptors or receptor-associated proteins. The p85 regulatory subunit binds phosphorylated motifs of activator proteins, which induces a conformational change that relieves p85-mediated inhibition of the p110 catalytic subunit and enables PI3K to phosphorylate PIP2 to form PIP3. The phosphoinositide kinase activity of PI3K is opposed by the phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of PTEN. <br><br>PIP3 acts as a messenger that recruits PDPK1 (PDK1) and AKT (AKT1, AKT2 or AKT3) to the plasma membrane. PDPK1 also possesses a low affinity for PIP2, so small amounts of PDPK1 are always present at the membrane. Binding of AKT to PIP3 induces a conformational change that enables TORC2 complex to phosphorylate AKT at a conserved serine residue (S473 in AKT1). Phosphorylation at the serine residue enables AKT to bind to PDPK1 and exposes a conserved threonine residue (T308) that is phosphorylated by PDPK1. AKT phosphorylated at both serine and threonine residues dissociates from the plasma membrane and acts as a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates a number of cytosolic and nuclear targets involved in regulation of cell metabolism, survival and gene expression.  For a recent review, please refer to Manning and Cantley, 2007.  <br>  Signaling by PI3K/AKT is frequently constitutively activated in cancer. This activation can be via gain-of-function mutations in PI3KCA (encoding catalytic subunit p110alpha), PIK3R1 (encoding regulatory subunit p85alpha) and AKT1. The PI3K/AKT pathway can also be constitutively activated by loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as PTEN. <br> Gain-of-function mutations activate PI3K signaling by diverse mechanisms. Mutations affecting the helical domain of PIK3CA and mutations affecting nSH2 and iSH2 domains of PIK3R1 impair inhibitory interactions between these two subunits while preserving their association. Mutations in the catalytic domain of PIK3CA enable the kinase to achieve an active conformation. PI3K complexes with gain-of-function mutations therefore produce PIP3 and activate downstream AKT in the absence of growth factors (Huang et al. 2007, Zhao et al. 2005, Miled et al. 2007, Horn et al. 2008, Sun et al. 2010, Jaiswal et al. 2009, Zhao and Vogt 2010, Urick et al. 2011).  While AKT1 gene copy number, expression level and phosphorylation are often increased in cancer, only one low frequency point mutation has been repeatedly reported in cancer and functionally studied. This mutation represents a substitution of a glutamic acid residue with lysine at position 17 of AKT1, and acts by enabling AKT1 to bind PIP2. PIP2-bound AKT1 is phosphorylated by TORC2 complex and by PDPK1 that is always present at the plasma membrane, due to low affinity for PIP2. Therefore, E17K substitution abrogates the need for PI3K in AKT1 activation (Carpten et al. 2007, Landgraf et al. 2008).  <br> Loss-of-function mutations affecting the phosphatase domain of PTEN are frequently found in sporadic cancers (Kong et al. 1997, Lee et al. 1999, Han et al. 2000), as well as in PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes (PHTS) (Marsh et al. 1998). PTEN can also be inactivated by gene deletion or epigenetic silencing, or indirectly by overexpression of microRNAs that target PTEN mRNA (Huse et al. 2009). Cells with deficient PTEN function have increased levels of PIP3, and therefore increased AKT activity. For a recent review, please refer to Hollander et al. 2011.<br> Because of their clear involvement in human cancers, PI3K and AKT are targets of considerable interest in the development of small molecule inhibitors. Although none of the currently available inhibitors display preference for mutant variants of PIK3CA or AKT, several inhibitors targeting the wild-type kinases are undergoing clinical trials. These include dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, class I PI3K inhibitors, pan-PI3K inhibitors, and pan-AKT inhibitors. While none have yet been approved for clinical use, these agents show promise for future therapeutics. In addition, isoform-specific PI3K and AKT inhibitors are currently being developed, and may provide more specific treatments along with reduced side-effects.

The p300/CBP and Rtt109 families are specific to metazoans and fungi respectively (Marmorstein & Trievel 2009). Gcn5/PCAF and MYST family members have no significant sequence homology but share a globular alpha/beta fold with a common structure involved in acetyl-Coenzyme A (ACA) binding.

However, additional nucleoside monophosphate kinase-like human proteins have been identified in molecular cloning studies whose enzymatic activities are unknown, and several distinctive nucleoside monophosphate kinase activities detected in cell extracts, e.g., a GTP-requiring adenylate kinase activity (Wilson et al. 1976) and one or more guanylate kinase activities (Jamil et al. 1975) have not been unambiguously associated with specific human proteins.<P>The nucleoside monophosphates against which each of the six well-characterized enzymes is active is shown in the table (Van Rompay et al. 2000).  All six efficiently use ATP as a phosphate donor, but have some activity with other nucleoside triphosphates as well in vitro.  The high concentrations of ATP relative to other nucleoside triphosphates in vivo makes it the likely major phosphate donor in these reactions under most conditions.<P>All of these phosphorylation reactions are freely reversible in vitro when carried out with purified enzymes and substrates, having equilibrium constants near 1.  In vivo, high ratios of ATP to ADP are likely to favor the forward direction of these reactions, i.e., the conversion of (d)NMP and ATP to (d)NDP and ADP.  At the same time, the reversibility of the reactions and the overlapping substrate specificities of the enzymes raises the possibility that this group of reactions can buffer the intracellular nucleotide pool and regulate the relative concentrations of individual nucleotides in the pool: if any one molecule builds up to unusually high levels, multiple routes appear to be open not only to dispose of it but to use it to increase the supply of less abundant nucleotides.<p>Ribonucleotide reductase catalyzes the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotide diphosphates from ribonucleotide diphosphates.''',

To date KDMs have been demonstrated to catalyse demethylation of N-epsilon methylated lysine residues. Biochemically there are two distinct groups of N-epsilon methylated lysine demethylases with different catalytic mechanisms, both of which result in methyl group oxidation to produce formaldhyde. KDM1A, formerly known as Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1), belongs to the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent amino oxidase family. The KDM1A reaction mechanism requires a protonatable lysine epsilon-amine group, not available in trimethylated lysines, which consequently are not KDM1 substrates. Other KDMs belong to the Jumonji C (JmjC) -domain containing family. These are members of the Cupin superfamily of mononuclear Fe (II)-dependent oxygenases, which are characterised by the presence of a double-stranded beta-helix core fold. They require 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and molecular oxygen as co-substrates, producing, in addition to formaldehyde, succinate and carbon dioxide. This hydroxylation-based mechanism does not require a protonatable lysine epsilon-amine group and consequently JmjC-containing demethylases are able to demethylate tri-, di- and monomethylated lysines.<br>The coordinates of post-translational modifications represented and described here follow UniProt standard practice whereby coordinates refer to the translated protein before any further processing.

In contrast, lysine-10 (H3K9) promoter methylation is considered a repressive mark for euchromatic genes and is also one of the landmark modifications associated with heterochromatin (Peters et al. 2002).<br>The first reported JmjC-containing demethylases were KDM2A/B (JHDM1A/B, FBXL11/10). These catalyse demethylation of histone H3 lysine-37 when mono- or di-methylated (H3K36Me1/2) (Tsukada et al. 2006). They were found to contain a JmjC catalytic domain, previously implicated in chromatin-dependent functions (Clissold & Ponting 2001). Subsequently, many other JmjC enzymes have been identified and discovered to have lysine demethylase activities with distinct methylation site and state specificities. <br>KDM3A/B (JHDM2A/B) are specific for mono or di-methylated lysine-10 on histone H3 (H3K9Me1/2) (Yamane et al. 2006, Kim et al. 2012).

KDM4D (JMJD2D) also catalyses demethylation of H3K9Me2/3 (Whetstine et al. 2007). KDM4A-C (JHDM3A-C) can also catalyse demethylation of lysine-37 of histone H3 (H3K36Me2/3) (Klose et al. 2006).

KDM6A and KDM6B (UTX/JMJD3) catalyse demethylation of di- or tri-methylated lysine-28 of histone H3 (H3K27Me2/3) (Agger et al. 2007, Cho et al. 2007, De Santra et al. 2007, Lan et al. 2007, Lee et al. 2007).<br><br>KDM7A (KIAA1718/JHDM1D) catalyses demethylation of mono- or di-methylated lysine-10 of histone H3 (H3K9Me1/2) and mono- and di-methylated lysine-28 of histone H3 (H3K27Me1/2) (Horton et al. 2010, Huang et al. 2010). PHF8 (JHDM1E) catalyses demethylation of mono- or di-methylated lysine-10 of histone H3 (H3K9Me1/2) and mono-methylated lysine-21 of histone H4 (H4K20Me1) (Loenarz et al. 2010, Horton et al. 2010, Feng et al. 2010, Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al. 2010, Fortschegger et al. 2010, Qi et al. 2010, Liu et al. 2010).

Loading of these peptides onto MHC-I molecules occurs directly within early and late endosomal compartments. Why certain antigens are cross-presented exclusively by the cytosolic pathway while others use the vacuolar pathway is unknown.

When blood glucose levels rise, insulin release stimulates glucose uptake from the blood, glucose breakdown (glycolysis), and glucose storage as glycogen. When blood glucose levels fall, glucagon release stimulates glycogen breakdown and de novo glucose synthesis (gluconeogenesis), while inhibiting glycolysis and glycogen synthesis.<br>At a molecular level, the binding of glucagon to the extracellular face of its receptor causes conformational changes in the receptor that allow the dissociation and activation of subunits Gs and Gq. The activation of Gq leads to the activation of phospholipase C, production of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, and subsequent release of intracellular calcium. The activation of Gs leads to activation of adenylate cyclase, an increase in intracellular cAMP levels, and activation of protein kinase A (PKA). Active PKA phosphorylates key enzymes of glycogenolysis, glycogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis, modifying their activities.

These longer transcripts are processed to yield piRNAs of 26-30 nucleotides independently of DICER, the enzyme responsible for microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (reviewed in Girard and Hannon 2008, Siomi et al. 2011, Ishizu et al. 2012, Pillai and Chuma 2012, Bortvin 2013, Chuma and Nakano 2013, Sato and Siomi 2013). The initial step in processing long transcripts to piRNAs is cleavage by PLD6 (MitoPLD), which generates the mature 5' end. The cleavage products of PLD6 are bound by either PIWIL1 (HIWI, MIWI) or PIWIL2 (HILI, MILI) in complexes with several other proteins. The 3' end is trimmed by an unknown exonuclease to generate the mature piRNA. PIWIL1:piRNA complexes appear to be involved in post-transcriptional silencing in the cytosol while PIWIL2:piRNA complexes generate further piRNAs from transposon transcripts and other transcripts in the cytosol. Cleavage products from PIWIL2:piRNA may be loaded into either PIWIL2 or PIWIL4 (HIWI2, MIWI2). Loading into PIWIL2 forms a step in a cytosolic amplification loop called the "ping-pong cycle" which yields further PIWIL2:piRNA complexes from cleaved precursor RNAs. Loading into PIWIL4 yields a complex also containing TDRD9 that translocates to the nucleus and directs DNA methylation of cognate loci, causing transcriptional silencing during spermatogenesis. Transcriptional silencing by piRNAs is necessary to limit transposition of endogenous transposons such as L1 elements in the genome.''',

    8855105: '''Rab GTPases are peripheral membrane proteins involved in membrane trafficking. Often through their indirect interactions with coat components, motors, tethering factors and SNAREs, the Rab GTPases serve as multifaceted organizers of almost all membrane trafficking processes in eukaryotic cells. To perform these diverse processes, Rab GTPases interconvert between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive, GDP-bound form. The GTP-bound activated form mediates membrane transport through specific interaction with multiple effector molecules (Zerial & McBride 2001, Stenmark 2009, Zhen & Stenmark 2015, Cherfils & Zeghouf 2013). Conversion from the GTP- to the GDP-bound form occurs through GTP hydrolysis, which is not only driven by the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Rab protein but is also catalysed by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). GAPs not only increase the rate of GTP hydrolysis, but they are also involved in the inactivation of RABs, making sure they are inactivated at the correct membrane. Human cells contain as many as 70 Rabs and at least 51 putative Rab GAPs (Pfeffer 2005). Only a few of these GAPs have been matched to a specific Rab substrate. The Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC) domain-containing RAB-specific GAPs (TBC/RABGAPs) are a key family of RAB regulators, where the TBC domain facilitates the inactivation of RABs by facilitating activation of GTPase activity of the RAB (Pan et al. 2006, Frasa et al. 2012, Stenmark 2009).

    1474122: '''Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential co-factor for the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases and glycerol ether monooxygenase and it regulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. Inherited BH4 deficiency leads to hyperphenylalaninemia, and dopamine and neurotransmitter deficiency in the brain. BH4 maintains enzymatic coupling to L-arginine oxidation to produce NO. Oxidation of BH4 to BH2 results in NOS uncoupling, resulting in superoxide (O2.-) formation rather than NO. Superoxide rapidly reacts with NO to produce peroxynitrite which can further uncouple NOS.<br>These reactive oxygen species (superoxide and peroxynitrite) can contribute to increased oxidative stress in the endothelium leading to atherosclerosis and hypertension (Thony et al. 2000, Crabtree and Channon 2011,Schulz et al. 2008, Schmidt and Alp 2007).  The synthesis, recycling and effects of BH4 are shown here. Three enzymes are required for the de novo biosynthesis of BH4 and two enzymes for the recycling of BH4.''',
    1498702: '''Signal transduction is a process in which extracellular signals elicit changes in cell state and activity. Transmembrane receptors sense changes in the cellular environment by binding ligands, such as hormones and growth factors, or reacting to other types of stimuli, such as light. Stimulation of transmembrane receptors leads to their conformational change which propagates the signal to the intracellular environment by activating downstream signaling cascades. Depending on the cellular context, this may impact cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival. On the organism level, signal transduction regulates overall growth and behavior.<br>Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) transmit extracellular signals by phosphorylating their protein partners on conserved tyrosine residues.  Some of the best studied RTKs are EGFR (reviewed in Avraham and Yarden, 2011), FGFR (reviewed in Eswarakumar et al, 2005), insulin receptor (reviewed in Saltiel and Kahn, 2001), NGF (reviewed in Reichardt, 2006), PDGF (reviewed in Andrae et al, 2008) and VEGF (reviewed in Xie et al, 2004).  RTKs frequently activate downstream signaling through RAF/MAP kinases (reviewed in McKay and Morrison, 2007 and Wellbrock et al 2004), AKT (reviewed in Manning and Cantley, 2007) and PLC- gamma (reviewed in Patterson et al, 2005), which ultimately results in changes in gene expression and cellular metabolism.  <br>Receptor serine/threonine kinases of the TGF-beta family, such as TGF-beta receptors (reviewed in Kang et al. 2009) and BMP receptors (reviewed in Miyazono et al. 2009), transmit extracellular signals by phosphorylating regulatory SMAD proteins on conserved serine and threonine residues. This leads to formation of complexes of regulatory SMADs and SMAD4, which translocate to the nucleus where they act as transcription factors.  <br>WNT receptors transmit their signal through beta-catenin. In the absence of ligand, beta-catenin is constitutively degraded in a ubiquitin-dependent manner. WNT receptor stimulation releases beta-catenin from the destruction complex, allowing it to translocate to the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional regulator (reviewed in MacDonald et al, 2009 and Angers and Moon, 2009).  WNT receptors were originally classified as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).  Although they are structurally related, GPCRs primarily transmit their signals through G-proteins, which are trimers of alpha, beta and gamma subunits. When a GPCR is activated, it acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, catalyzing GDP to GTP exchange on the G-alpha subunit of the G protein and its dissociation from the gamma-beta heterodimer.  The G-alpha subunit regulates the activity of adenylate cyclase, while the gamma-beta heterodimer can activate AKT and PLC signaling (reviewed in Rosenbaum et al. 2009, Oldham and Hamm 2008, Ritter and Hall 2009). <br>NOTCH receptors are activated by transmembrane ligands expressed on neighboring cells, which results in cleavage of NOTCH receptor and release of its intracellular domain. NOTCH intracellular domain translocates to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor (reviewed in Kopan and Ilagan, 2009). <br>Integrins are activated by extracellular matrix components, such as fibronectin and collagen, leading to conformational change and clustering of integrins on the cell surface.  This results in activation of integrin-linked kinase and other cytosolic kinases and, in co-operation with RTK signaling, regulates survival, proliferation and cell shape and adhesion (reviewed in Hehlgans et al, 2007) .  <br>Besides inducing changes in gene expression and cellular metabolism, extracellular signals that trigger the activation of Rho GTP-ases can trigger changes in the organization of cytoskeleton, thereby regulating cell polarity and cell-cell junctions (reviewed in Citi et al, 2011).''',

This residue falls in a highly conserved Pro-Ser dipeptide between the second and third Ig domains of the extracellular region of the receptor. The mutation is thought to increase the number of hydrogen bonds formed with the ligand and to thereby increase ligand-binding affinity (Ibrahimi, 2004a). Unlike other FGF receptors, few activating point mutations in the FGFR1 coding sequence have been identified in cancer.  Point mutations in the Ig II-III linker analagous to the P252R Pfeiffer syndrome mutation have been identified in lung cancer and melanoma (Ruhe, 2007; Davies, 2005), and two kinase-domain mutations in FGFR1 have been identified in glioblastoma (Rand, 2005, Network TCGA, 2008).<br><br>In contrast,  FGFR1 is a target of chromosomal rearrangements in a number of cancers.

    69204: '''The transition from the G1 to S phase is controlled by the Cyclin E:Cdk2 complexes. As the Cyclin E:Cdk2 complexes are formed, the Cdk2 is phosphorylated by the Wee1 and Myt1 kinases. This phosphorylation keeps the Cdk2 inactive. In yeast this control is called the cell size checkpoint control.  The dephosphorylation of the Cdk2 by Cdc25A activates the Cdk2, and is coordinated with the cells reaching the proper size, and with the DNA synthesis machinery being ready. The Cdk2 then phosphorylates G1/S specific proteins, including proteins required for DNA replication initiation. The beginning of S-phase is marked by the first nucleotide being laid down on the primer during DNA replication at the early-firing origins.Failure to appropriately regulate cyclin E accumulation can lead to accelerated S phase entry, genetic instability, and tumorigenesis.

The process starts in the mitochondria with the condensation of succinyl CoA (from the TCA cycle) and glycine to form 5-aminolevulinate (ALA). The next four steps take place in the cytosol. Two molecules of ALA are condensed to form the monopyrrole porphobilinogen (PBG). The next two steps convert four molecules of PBG into the cyclic tetrapyrrole uroporphyringen III, which is then decarboxylated into coproporphyrinogen III. The last three steps occur in the mitochondria and involve modifications to the tetrapyrrole side chains and finally, insertion of iron. In addition to these synthetic steps, a spontaneous cytosolic reaction allows the formation of uroporphyringen I which is then enzymatically decarboxylated to coproporphyrinogen I, which cannot be metabolized further.<p>Two heme biosynthetic processes can be distinguished in vivo: one confined to immature erythroid cells that provides the large amount of heme needed for hemoglobin, and a ubiquitous one that provides the variable amounts of heme needed for cytochrome P450 enzymes (Riddle et al. 1989).

    265835: '''Genetic recombination and the repair of double strand DNA breaks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae require Rad51, a homologue of the Escherichia coli RecA protein. In vitro, Rad51 binds DNA to form an extended nucleoprotein filament and catalyzes the ATP-dependent exchange of DNA between molecules with homologous sequences. Vertebrate Rad51 is essential for cell proliferation. The core reactions of homologous pairing, strand-transfer, exchange and annealing require RAD51 and its paralogs. These paralogs show high degree of divergence from RAD51 as well as from each other although the individual paralogs are well conserved between human and chicken cells. It has been suggested that Rad51 and Rad52 act cooperatively. In chicken RAD52 (-/-) cells, intrachromosomal recombination as measured by immunoglobulin gene conversion, and radiation-induced Rad51 nuclear focus formation (which is a putative intermediate step during recombinational repair), are unaffected. However, RAD52 has a clear role in genetic recombination because the frequency of targeted integration is reduced in RAD52 (-/-) cells. Although RAD52 can partially substitute for XRCC3 (one of the RAD51 paralogs), the rad52 xrcc3 double-mutant cells are non viable and exhibit extensive chromosomal breaks, indicating an overlapping (but non-reciprocal) role for RAD52 and XRCC3 in repairing DNA double-strand breaks.

The nuclear lamina is located at the nuclear face of the inner nuclear membrane and plays and important role in the structure and function of the nuclear envelope (reviewed by Burke and Stewart 2012). Depolymerisation of lamin filaments, which consist of lamin homodimers associated through electrostatic interactions in head-to-tail molecular strings, is triggered by phosphorylation of lamins.

    2395783: '''Visual phototransduction is the process by which photon absorption by visual pigment molecules in photoreceptor cells is converted to an electrical cellular response. The events in this process are photochemical, biochemical and electrophysiological and are highly conserved across many species. This process occurs in two types of photoreceptors in the retina, rods and cones. Each type consists of two parts, the outer segment which detects a photon signal and the inner segment which contains the necessary machinery for cell metabolism. Each type of cell functions differently. Rods are very light sensitive but their flash response is slow so they work best in twilight conditions but are not good at detecting objects moving quickly. Cones are less light-sensitive and have a fast flash response so they work best in daylight conditions and are better at detecting fast moving objects than rods.<br><br>The visual pigment consists of a chromophore (11-cis-retinal, 11cRAL, A1) covalently attached to a GPCR opsin family member. The linkage is via a Schiff base forming retinylidene protein. Upon photon absorption, 11cRAL isomerises to all-trans retinal (atRAL), changing the conformation of opsin to an activated form which can activate the regulatory G protein transducin (Gt). The alpha subunit of Gt activates phosphodiesterase which hydrolyses cGMP to 5'-GMP. As high level of cGMP keep cGMP-gated sodium channels open, the lowering of cGMP levels closes these channels which causes hyperpolarization of the cell and subsequently, closure of voltage-gated calcium channels. As calcium levels drop, the level of the neurotransmitter glutamate also drops causing depolarization of the cell. This effectively relays the light signal to postsynaptic neurons as electrical signal (Burns & Pugh 2010, Korenbrot 2012, Pugh & Lamb 1993).<br><br>11cRAL cannot be synthesised in vertebrates.

WNT proteins exist in a gradient outside the secreting cell and are able to act over both short and long ranges to promote proliferation, changes in cell migration and polarity and tissue homeostasis, among others (reviewed in Saito-Diaz et al, 2012; Willert and Nusse, 2012).  <br><br><br>The WNTs are ~40kDa proteins with 23 conserved cysteine residues in the N-terminal that may form intramolecular disulphide bonds.

In addition to being glycosylated, WNTs are also lipid-modified in the endoplasmic reticulum by a WNT-specific O-acyl-transferase, Porcupine (PORCN), contributing to their characteristic hydrophobicity.  PORCN-dependent palmitoylation is required for the secretion of WNT as well as its signaling activity, as either depletion of PORCN or mutation of the conserved serine acylation site results in the intracellular accumulation of WNT ligand (Takada et al, 2006; Barrott et al, 2011; Biechele et al, 2011; reviewed in Willert and Nusse, 2012).<br><br><br>Secretion of WNT requires a number of other dedicated factors including the sorting receptor Wntless (WLS) (also knownas Evi, Sprinter, and GPR177), which binds WNT and escorts it to the cell surface (Banziger et al, 2006; Bartscherer et al, 2006; Goodman et al, 2006).

In healthy mitochondria, PINK1 is imported to the inner mitochondrial membrane, presumably through the TOM/TIM complex. The TIM complex associated protease, mitochondrial MPP, cleaves PINK1 mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS). PINK1 may be cleaved by the inner membrane presenilin associated rhomboid like protease (PARL) and ultimately proteolytically degraded. Loss of membrane potential in damaged mitochondria prevents the import of the PTEN induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) which accumulates in the defective mitochondria triggering the recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (Parkin). Once on the mitochondria, Parkin promotes the ubiquitination of mitochondrial substrates embedded in the OMM such as the mitofusin Mitochondrial Assembly Regulatory Factor (MARF), mitofusin 1 and 2 (Mfn1, 2) and the Voltage Dependent Anion Channel 1 (VDAC1).  After the ubiquitination events, p62 is recruited to mitochondria, binding the Parkin ubiquitinated substrates, linking the ubiquitinated substrates to the Microtubule associated protein Autophagy marker Light Chain 3 (LC3).

In the matrix, Ca2+ binds and allosterically regulates pyruvate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, and possibly other enzymes (Rizzuto et al. 2012). Matrix calcium is also observed to regulate release of caspase cofactors and calcium flux through channels on neighboring membranes, The pathway into the mitochondrion involves VDAC1, VDAC2, and VDAC3 in the outer membrane and the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex in the inner membrane. VDACs in the open conformation are anion channels. However in the closed conformation they transport Ca2+ from the cytosol to the intermembrane space. When calcium concentrations in the cytosol and intermembrane space are high, the MCU complex opens and transports Ca2+ from the intermembrane space to the mitochondrial matrix using the driving force of the membrane potential (reviewed in Drago et al. 2011, Marchi et al. 2014, De Stefani et al. 2015).<br>Efflux of Ca2+ from the matrix to the intermembrane space is catalyzed by the Na+/Ca2+ antiporter SLC8B1 (NCLX) located in the inner membrane.

    3247771: '''WNT signaling pathways control a wide range of developmental and adult process in metozoans including cell proliferation, cell fate decisions, cell polarity and stem cell maintenance (reviewed in Saito-Diaz et al, 2013; MacDonald et al, 2009).  The pathway is named for the WNT ligands, a large family of secreted cysteine-rich glycoproteins. At least 19 WNT members have been identified in humans and mice with distinct expression patterns during development (reviewed in Willert and Nusse, 2012).  These ligands can activate at least three different downstream signaling cascades depending on which receptors they engage. <br>  In the so-called 'canonical' WNT signaling pathway, WNT ligands bind one of the 10 human Frizzled (FZD) receptors in conjunction with the LRP5/6 co-receptors to activate a transcriptional cascade that controls processes such as cell fate, proliferation and self-renenwal of stem cells.  Engagement of the FZD-LRP receptor by WNT ligand results in the stabilization and translocation of cytosolic beta-catenin to the nucleus where it is a co-activator for LEF (lymphoid enhancer-binding factor)- and TCF (T cell factor) -dependent transcription.  In the absence of WNT ligand, cytosolic beta-catenin is phosphorylated by a degradation complex consisting of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), casein kinase 1 (CK1), Axin and Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and subsequently ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26S proteasome (reviewed in Saito-Diaz et al, 2013; Kimmelman and Xu, 2006). <br>  In addition to the beta-catenin-dependent transcriptional response, WNT signaling can also activate distinct non-transcriptional pathways that regulate cell migration and polarity.  These beta-catenin-independent 'non-canonical' pathways signal through Frizzled receptors independently of LRP5/6, or occur through the tyrosine kinase receptors ROR and RYK (reviewed in Veeman et al, 2003; James et al, 2009).  Non-canonical WNT pathways are best studied in Drosophila where the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway controls the orientation of wing hairs and eye facets, but are also involved in processes such as convergent extension, neural tube closure, inner ear development and hair orientation in vertebrates and mammals(reviewed in Seifert and Mlodzik, 2007; Simons and Mlodzik, 2008). In the PCP pathway, binding of WNT ligand to the FZD receptor leads to activation of small Rho GTPases and JNK, which regulate the cytoskeleton and coordinate cell migration and polarity (reviewed in Lai et al, 2009; Schlessinger et al, 2009).  In some cases, a FZD-WNT interaction increases intracellular calcium concentration and activates CaMK II and PKC; this WNT calcium pathway promotes cell migration and inhibits the canonical beta-catenin dependent transcriptional pathway (reviewed in Kuhl et al, 2000; Kohn and Moon, 2005; Rao et al 2010).  Binding of WNT to ROR or RYK receptors also regulates cell migration, apparently through activation of JNK or SRC kinases, respectively, however the details of these pathways remain to be worked out (reviewed in Minami et al, 2010).<br> Although the WNT signaling pathways were originally viewed as discrete, linear pathways controlled by defined subsets of 'canonical' or 'non-canonical' ligands and receptors, the emerging evidence is challenging this notion.  Instead, the specificity and the downstream response appear to depend on the particular cellular context and vary with species, tissue and stage of development (reviewed in van Amerongen and Nusse, 2009; Rao et al, 2010).''',

The lengths of collagen fibrils in mature tissues are largely unknown but in tendon can be measured in millimetres (Craig et al. 1989). Collagen fibrils isolated from adult bovine corneal stroma had ~350 collagen molecules in transverse section, tapering down to three molecules at the growing tip (Holmes & Kadler 2005). <br><br>The classical view of collagenases is that they actively unwind the triple helical chain, a process termed molecular tectonics (Overall 2002, Bode & Maskos 2003), before preferentially cleaving the alpha2 chain followed by the remaining chains (Chung et al. 2004). More recently it has been suggested that collagen fibrils exist in an equilibrium between protected and vulnerable states (Stultz 2002, Nerenberg & Stultz 2008). The prototypical triple-helical structure of collagen does not fit into the active site of collagenase MMPs. In addition the scissile bonds are not solvent-exposed and are therefore inaccessible to the collagenase active site (Chung et al. 2004, Stultz 2002). It was realized that collagen must locally unfold into non-triple helical regions to allow collagenolysis. Observations using circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry confirm that there is considerable heterogeneity along collagen fibres (Makareeva et al. 2008) allowing access for MMPs at physiological temperatures (Salsas-Escat et al. 2010).<br><br>Collagen fibrils with cut chains are unstable and accessible to proteinases that cannot cleave intact collagen strands (Woessner & Nagase 2000, Somerville et al. 2003).

Degradation of collagen types other than I-III is less well characterized but believed to occur in a similar manner. <br><br>Metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a major part in the degradation of several extracellular macromolecules including collagens. MMP1 (Welgus et al. 1981), MMP8 (Hasty et al. 1987), and MMP13 (Knauper et al. 1996), sometimes referred to as collagenases I, II and III respectively, are able to initiate the intrahelical cleavage of the major fibril forming collagens I, II and III at neutral pH, and thus thought to define the rate-limiting step in normal tissue remodeling events. All can cleave additional  substrates including other collagen subtypes. Collagenases cut collagen alpha chains at a single conserved Gly-Ile/Leu site approximately 3/4 of the molecule's length from the N-terminus (Fields 1991, Chung et al. 2004). The cleavage site is characterised by the motif  G(I/L)(A/L); the G-I/L bond is cleaved. In collagen type I this corresponds to G953-I954 in the Uniprot canonical alpha chain sequences (often given as G775-I776 in literature). It is not clear why only this bond is cleaved, as the motif occurs at several other places in the chain. MMP14, a membrane-associated MMP also known as Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MT-MMP1), is able to cleave collagen types I, II and III (Ohuchi et al. 1997).''',

This strand is designated as the leading strand. The other strand grows in the direction away from fork movement, and is called the lagging strand. Several specific interactions among the various proteins involved in DNA replication underlie the mechanism of DNA synthesis, on both the leading and lagging strands, at a DNA replication fork.

    5672619: '''Mammals have three RAF isoforms, A, B and C, that are activated downstream of RAS and stimulate the MAPK pathway. Although CRAF (also known as RAF-1) was the first identified and remains perhaps the best studied, BRAF is most similar to the RAF expressed in other organisms. Notably, MAPK (ERK) activation is more compromised in BRAF-deficient cells than in CRAF or ARAF deficient cells (Bonner et al, 1985; Mikula et al, 2001, Huser et al, 2001, Mercer et al, 2002; reviewed in Leicht et al, 2007; Matallanas et al, 2011; Cseh et al, 2014). Consistent with its important role in MAPK pathway activation, mutations in the BRAF gene, but not in those for A- or CRAF, are associated with cancer development (Davies et al, 2002; reviewed in Leicht et al, 2007). ARAF and CRAF may have arisen through gene duplication events, and may play additional roles in MAPK-independent signaling (Hindley and Kolch, 2002; Murakami and Morrison, 2001).<br>Despite divergences in function, all mammalian RAF proteins share three conserved regions (CRs) and each interacts with RAS and MEK proteins, although with different affinities. The N-terminal CR1 contains a RAS-binding domain (RBD) and a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that mediate interactions with RAS and the phospholipid membrane. CR2 contains inhibitory phosphorylation sites that impact RAS binding and RAF activation, while the C-terminal CR3 contains the bi-lobed kinase domain with its activation loop, and an adjacent upstream "N-terminal acidic motif" -S(S/G)YY in C- and A-RAF,respectively, and SSDD in B-RAF - that is required for RAF activation (Tran et al, 2005; Dhillon et al, 2002; Chong et al, 2001; Cutler et al, 1998; Chong et al, 2003; reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011).<br><br>Regulation of RAF activity involves multiple phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events, intramolecular conformational changes, homo- and heterodimerization between RAF monomers and changes to protein binding partners, including scaffolding proteins which bring pathway members together (reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011; Cseh et al, 2014). The details of this regulation are not completely known and differ slightly from one RAF isoform to another. Briefly, in the inactive state, RAF phosphorylation on conserved serine residues in CR2 promote an interaction with 14-3-3 dimers, maintaining the kinase in a closed conformation. Upon RAS activation, these sites are dephosphorylated, allowing the RAF CRD and RBD to bind RAS and phospholipids, facilitating membrane recruitment.  RAF activation requires homo- or heterodimerization, which promotes autophosphorylation in the activation loop of the receiving monomer.  Of the three isoforms, only BRAF is able to initiate this allosteric activation of other RAF monomers (Hu et al, 2013; Heidorn et al, 2010; Garnett et al, 2005). This activity depends on negative charge in the N-terminal acidic region (NtA; S(S/G)YY or SSDD) adjacent to the kinase domain. In BRAF, this region carries permanent negative charge due to the presence of the two aspartate residues in place of the tyrosine residues of A- and CRAF.  In addition, unique to BRAF, one of the serine residues of the NtA is constitutively phosphorylated.  In A- and CRAF, residues in this region are subject to phosphorylation by activated MEK downstream of RAF activation, establishing a positive feedback loop and allowing activated A- and CRAF monomers to act as transactivators in turn (Hu et al, 2013; reviewed in Cseh et al, 2014). RAF signaling is terminated through dephosphorylation of the NtA region and phosphorylation of the residues that mediate the inhibitory interaction with 14-3-3, promoting a return to the inactive state (reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011; Cseh et al, 2014).<br>''',

    5205684: '''Mitophagy is a specific form of autophagy where mitochondria are specifically targeted for degradation by autophagolysosomes.. In mammals there are a number of known mechanisms of mitophagy. One insures maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA through the elimination of sperm derived mitochondria. A second is elimination of functional mitochondria during erythrocyte maturation and eye lens maturation.  It is established that the outer mitochondrial membrane receptor Nix (or Bnip3l) and autophagosome associated protein LC3 are important for mitochondrial degradation in erythrocytes. A third mechanism is driven by the Pink1 and Parkin proteins. Parkin is recruited to the mitochondria when the mitochondrial membrane potential is reduced due to uncoupling, thereby initiating mitophagy.''',

    69307: '''Studies in the past decade have suggested that the basic mechanism of DNA replication initiation is conserved in all kingdoms of life. Initiation in unicellular eukaryotes, in particular Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast), is well understood, and has served as a model for studies of DNA replication initiation in multicellular eukaryotes, including humans. In general terms, the first step of initiation is the binding of the replication initiator to the origin of replication. The replicative helicase is then assembled onto the origin, usually by a helicase assembly factor. Either shortly before or shortly after helicase assembly, some local unwinding of the origin of replication occurs in a region rich in adenine and thymine bases (often termed a DNA unwinding element, DUE). The unwound region provides the substrate for primer synthesis and initiation of DNA replication. The best-defined eukaryotic origins are those of S. cerevisiae, which have well-conserved sequence elements for initiator binding, DNA unwinding and binding of accessory proteins. In multicellular eukaryotes, unlike S. cerevisiae, these loci appear not to be defined by the presence of a DNA sequence motif. Indeed, choice of replication origins in a multicellular eukaryote may vary with developmental stage and tissue type. In cell-free models of metazoan DNA replication, such as the one provided by Xenopus egg extracts, there are only limited DNA sequence specificity requirements for replication initiation (Kelly & Brown 2000; Bell & Dutta 2002; Marahrens & Stillman 1992; Cimbora & Groudine 2001; Mahbubani et al 1992, Hyrien & Mechali 1993).''',
    5668544: '''Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA) exerts a wide range of biological effects through TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2). Under normal physiological conditions TNFR2 exhibits more restricted expression, being found on certain subpopulation of immune cells and few other cell types (Grell et al. 1995 ). TNFR1 mediated signalling pathways have been very well characterized but, TNFR2 has been much less well studied. TNFR1 upon activation by TNFA activates apoptosis through two pathways, involving the adaptor proteins TNFR1-associated death domain (TRADD) and fas-associated death domain (FADD). In contrast, TNFR2 signalling especially in highly activated T cells, induces cell survival pathways that can result in cell proliferation by activating transcription factor NF-kB (nuclear factor-kB) via the alternative non-canonical route. TNFR2 signalling seems to play an important role, in particular for the function of regulatory T cells. It offers protective roles in several disorders, including autoimmune diseases, heart diseases, demyelinating and neurodegenerative disorders and infectious diseases (Faustman & Davis 2010).<br>Activation of the non-canonical pathway by TNFR2 is mediated through a signalling complex that includes TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF2 and TRAF3), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP1 and cIAP2), and NF-kB-inducing kinase (NIK). In this complex TRAF3 functions as a bridging factor between the cIAP1/2:TRAF2 complex and NIK. In resting cells cIAP1/2 in the signalling complex mediates K48-linked polyubiquitination of NIK and subsequent proteasomal degradation making NIK levels invisible. Upon TNFR2 stimulation, TRAF2 is recruited to the intracellular TRAF binding motif and this also indirectly recruits TRAF1 and cIAP1/2, as well as TRAF3 and NIK which are already bound to TRAF2 in unstimulated cells. TRAF2 mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of cIAP1/2 and this in turn mediates cIAP dependent K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 leading to the proteasome-dependent degradation of the latter. As TRAF3 is degraded, NIK can no longer interact with TRAF1/2:cIAP complex. As a result NIK concentration in the cytosol increases and NIK gets stabilised and activated. Activated NIK phosphorylates IKKalpha, which in turn phosphorylates p100 (NFkB2) subunit. Phosphorylated p100 is also ubiquitinated by the SCF-beta-TRCP ubiquitin ligase complex and is subsequently processed by the proteaseome to p52, which is a transcriptionally competent NF-kB subunit in conjunction with RelB (Petrus et al. 2011, Sun 2011, Vallabhapurapu & Karin 2009).''',

KS can perform a structural function and is found in bone, cartilage and the cornea. In joints, it also acts as a shock absorber due to its highly hydrated nature. There are several classes of KS, KSI, II and III. KSI is N-linked to asparagine (Asn) residues in the core protein and is predominantly found in the cornea. KSII is O-linked to serine (Ser) or Thr (threonine) residues in the core protein and is found predominantly in cartilage linked to the protein aggrecan, forming the most abundant proteoglycan in cartilage.

    8937166: '''The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix/PER-ARNT-SIM family of DNA binding proteins and controls the expression of a diverse set of genes. Two major types of environmental compounds can activate AHR signaling: halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) such as benzo(a)pyrene. Unliganded AHR forms a complex in the cytosol with two copies of 90kD heat shock protein (HSP90AB1), one X-associated protein (AIP), and one p23 molecular chaperone protein (PTGES3). After ligand binding and activation, the AHR complex translocates to the nucleus, disassociates from the chaperone subunits, dimerises with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) and transactivates target genes via binding to xenobiotic response elements (XREs) in their promoter regions. AHR targets genes of Phase I and Phase II metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), cytochorme P450 1B1 (CYP1B1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase I (NQO1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 (ALHD3A1). This is thought to be an organism's response to foreign chemical exposure and normally, foreign chemicals are made less reactive by the induction and therefore increased activity of these enzymes (Beischlag et al. 2008).<br><br>AHR itself is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR, aka BHLHE77, KIAA1234), an evolutionarily conserved bHLH-PAS protein that inhibits both xenobiotic-induced and constitutively active AHR transcriptional activity in many species. AHRR  resides predominantly in the nuclear compartment where it competes with AHR for binding to ARNT. As a result, there is competition between AHR:ARNT and AHRR:ARNT complexes for binding to XREs in target genes and AHRR can repress the transcription activity of AHR (Hahn et al. 2009, Haarmann-Stemmann & Abel 2006).''',

In the absence of a COPI coat, the membrane curvature necessary to initiate tubulation may be provided through the action of phospholipase A, which hydrolyzes phospholipids at the sn2 position to yield lysophospholipids. This activity is countered by lysophospholipid acyltransferases, and the balance of these may influence whether transport tubules or transport vesicles form (de Figuiredo et al, 1998; reviewed in Bechler et al, 2012).

    1461979: '''Humans have 38 beta-defensin genes plus 9-10 pseudogenes (details available on the HGNC website at http://www.genenames.org/genefamilies/DEFB). Many beta-defensins are encoded by recently duplicated genes giving rise to identical transcripts. Nomenclature is confusing and currently in transition. Uniprot recommended names are used throughout this pathway.<br>Many beta-defensins show expression that correlates with infection (Sahl et al. 2005, Pazgier et al. 2006). All so far characterized beta-defensins, i.e. beta-defensin 1 (hBD1), 4A (hBD2), 103 (hBD3), 104 (hBD4), 106 (hBD6), 118 (hBD18) and 128 (hBD28) have antimicrobial properties (Pazgier et al. 2006). For beta-defensins 4A, 103 and 118 (hBD2, 3, and 18) this has been shown to correlate with membrane permeabilization effects (Antcheva et al. 2004, Sahl et al. 2005, Yenugu et al. 2004). Electrostatic interaction and disruption of microbial membranes is widely believed to the primary mechanism of action for beta-defensins. Two models explain how membrane disruption takes place, the 'pore model' which postulates that beta-defensins form transmembrane pores in a similar manner to alpha-defensins, and the 'carpet model', which suggests that beta-defensins act as detergents. Beta-defensins contain 6 conserved cysteine residues that in beta-defensins 1, 4A and 103 (hBD1-3) are experimentally confirmed to be cross-linked 1-5, 2-4, 3-6. The canonical sequence for beta-defensins is x2-10Cx5-6(G/A)xCX3-4Cx9-13Cx4-7CCxn. Structurally they are similar to alpha-defensins but with much shorter pre-regions. Though dimerization of some beta-defensins has been reported this is not the case for all and it is unclear whether it is required for function. The majority of functional studies have focused on beta-defensin 103 (hBD3), which has the most significant antimicrobial activity at physiological salt concentrations (Harder et al. 2001). Beta-defensin 103  is highly cationic with a net charge of +11 e0.  It exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and some gram-negative bacteria (Harder et al. 2001), though some species are highly resistant (Sahly et al. 2003). Sensitivity correlates with lipid composition of the membrane, with more negatively-charged lipids correlating with larger beta-defensin 103-induced changes in membrane capacitance (Bohling et al. 2006). Though membrane disruption is widely believed to be the primary mechanism of action of beta-defensins they have other antimicrobial properties, such as inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis (Sass et al. 2010), and chemoattractant effects (Yang et al. 1999, Niyonsaba et al. 2002, 2004). The chemotactic activity of beta-defensins 1, 4A and 103 (hBD1-3) for memory T cells and immature DCs is mediated through binding to the chemokine receptor CCR6 and probably another unidentified Gi-coupled receptor (Yang et al. 1999, 2000). <br> <br>Like defensins, the human cathelicidin LL37 peptide is rich in positively-charged  residues (Lehrer & Ganz 2002).<br>Expression of certain beta-defensins can be induced in response to various signals, such as bacteria, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), or proinflammatory cytokines (Ganz 2003, Yang et al. 2004).

    8851165: '''The trans-Golgi network is the docking site for retrograde cargo from the endolysosomal system and the plasma membrane.  Typical cargo includes recycling resident TGN proteins such as TGOLN2 (also known as TGN46), receptors such as the mannose-6-phosphate receptors and toxins like Shiga, cholera and ricin which use the retrograde trafficking machinery to 'hitchhike' back through the secretory system for release into the cytoplasm (reviewed in Johannes and Popoff, 2008; Pfeffer, 2011; Sandvig et al, 2013).  These cargo are trafficked from the endocytic system in a clathrin- and AP1-dependent manner that is described in more detail in the "Trans-Golgi network budding pathway" (just not yet). In general, it appears that vesicles are uncoated prior to their tethering and fusion at the TGN.  At the TGN, at least 2 distinct tethering pathways exist. A RAB6-dependent pathway contributes to the fusion and docking of vesicles from the early endocytic pathway.  These vesicles, which carry cargo such as TGOLN2 and toxins, dock at the TGN through interactions with TGN-localized Golgin tethers and with the multisubunit tethering complexes COG and GARP (reviewed in Bonafacino and Rojas, 2006; Bonafacino and Hierro, 2011; Pfeffer, 2011).

    622304: '''The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading microorganisms, a broad specificity response characterized by the recruitment and activation of phagocytes and the release of anti-bacterial peptides. The receptors involved recognize conserved molecules present in microbes called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and/or molecules that are produced as a result of tissue injury, the damage associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs). PAMPs are essential to the pathogen and therefore unlikely to vary. Examples are lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycans (PGNs) and viral RNA. DAMPs include intracellular proteins, such as heat-shock proteins and extracellular matrix proteins released by tissue injury, such as hyaluronan fragments. Non-protein DAMPs include ATP, uric acid, heparin sulfate and dsDNA. The receptors for these factors are referred to collectively as pathogen- or pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). The best studied of these are the membrane-associated Toll-like receptor family. Less well studied but more numerous are the intracellular nucleotide-binding domain, leucine rich repeat containing receptors (NLRs) also called nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, a family with over 20 members in humans and over 30 in mice. These recognise PAMPs/DAMPs from phagocytosed microorganisms or from intracellular infections (Kobayashi et al. 2003, Proell et al. 2008, Wilmanski et al. 2008). Some NLRs are involved in process unrelated to pathogen detection such as tissue homeostasis, apoptosis, graft-versus-host disease and early development (Kufer & Sansonetti 2011). <br><br><br>Structurally NLRs can be subdivided into the caspase-recruitment domain (CARD)-containing NLRCs (NODs) and the pyrin domain (PYD)-containing NLRPs (NALPs), plus outliers including ice protease (caspase-1) activating factor (IPAF) (Martinon & Tschopp, 2005). In practical terms, NLRs can be divided into the relatively well characterized NOD1/2 which signal via RIP2 primarily to NFkappaB, and the remainder, some of which participate in macromolecular structures called Inflammasomes that activate caspases. Mutations in several members of the NLR protein family have been linked to inflammatory diseases, suggesting these molecules play important roles in maintaining host-pathogen interactions and inflammatory responses.<br><br><br>Most NLRs have a tripartite structure consisting of a variable amino-terminal domain, a central nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD or NACHT) that is believed to mediate the formation of self oligomers, and a carboxy-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) that detects PAMPs/DAMPs. In most cases the amino-terminal domain includes protein-interaction modules, such as CARD or PYD, some harbour baculovirus inhibitor repeat (BIR) or other domains. For most characterised NLRs these domains have been attributed to downstream signaling<br><br>Under resting conditions, NLRs are thought to be present  in an autorepressed form, with the LRR folded back onto the NACHT domain preventing oligomerization. Accessory proteins may help maintain the inactive state.

    622305: '''NOD1 is ubiquitously expressed, while NOD2 expression is restricted to monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and intestinal Paneth cells (Inohara et al. 2005). NOD1 and NOD2 activation induces transcription of immune response genes, predominantly mediated by the proinflammatory transcriptional factor NFkappaB but also by AP-1 and Elk-1 (Inohara et al. 2005). NFkappaB translocates to the nucleus following release from IkappaB proteins. NOD1 and NOD2 signaling involves an interaction between their caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) and the CARD of the kinase RIPK2 (RIP2/RICK). This leads to the activation of the NFkappaB pathway and MAPK pathways (Windheim et al. 2007).<br>Activated NODs oligomerize via their NACHT domains, inducing physical proximity of RIP2 proteins that is believed to trigger their K63-linked polyubiquitination, facilitating recruitment of the TAK1 complex. RIP2 also recruits NEMO, bringing the TAK1 and IKK complexes into proximity, leading to NF-kappaB activation and activation of MAPK signaling. Recent studies have demonstrated that K63-linked regulatory ubiquitination of RIP2 is essential for the recruitment of TAK1 (Hasegawa et al. 2008, Hitosumatsu et al. 2008). As observed for toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, ubiquitination can be removed by the deubiquitinating enzyme A20, thereby dampening NOD1/NOD2-induced NF-kappaB activation. NOD1 and NOD2 both induce K63-linked ubiquitination of RIP2, but NOD2-signaling appears to preferentially utilize the E3 ligase TRAF6, while TRAF2 and TRAF5 were shown to be important for NOD1-mediated signaling. In both cases, activation of NF-kappaB results in the upregulated transcription and production of inflammatory mediators.''',
    8875744: '''MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) (Cooper et al. 1984, Park et al. 1984) activated by binding to its ligand, Hepatocyte growth factor/Scatter factor (HGF/SF) (Bottaro et al. 1991, Naldini et al. 1991). Similar to other related RTKs, such as EGFR, ligand binding induces MET dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation, resulting in the active MET receptor complex (Ferracini et al. 1991, Longati et al. 1994, Rodrigues and Park 1994, Kirchhofer et al. 2004, Stamos et al. 2004, Hays and Watowich 2004). Phosphorylated tyrosines in the cytoplasmic tail of MET serve as docking sites for binding of adapter proteins, such as GRB2, SHC1 and GAB1, which trigger signal transduction cascades that activate PI3K/AKT, RAS, STAT3, PTK2, RAC1 and RAP1 signaling (Ponzetto et al. 1994, Pelicci et al. 1995, Weidner et al. 1995, Besser et al. 1997, Shen and Novak 1997, Beviglia and Kramer 1999, Rodrigues et al. 2000, Sakkab et al. 2000, Schaeper et al. 2000, Lamorte et al. 2002, Wang et al. 2002, Chen and Chen 2006, Palamidessi et al. 2008, Chen et al. 2011, Murray et al. 2014).<br>Activation of PLC gamma 1 (PLCG1) signaling by MET remains unclear. It has been reported that PLCG1 can bind to MET directly (Ponzetto et al. 1994) or be recruited by phosphorylated GAB1 (Gual et al. 2000). Tyrosine residue Y307 of GAB1 that serves as docking sites for PLCG1 may be phosphorylated either by activated MET (Watanabe et al. 2006) or SRC (Chan et al. 2010). Another PCLG1 docking site on GAB1, tyrosine residue Y373, was reported as the SRC target, while the kinase for the main PLCG1 docking site, Y407 of GAB1, is not known (Chan et al. 2010).<br>Signaling by MET promotes cell growth, cell survival and motility, which are essential for embryonic development (Weidner et al. 1993, Schmidt et al. 1995, Uehara et al. 1995, Bladt et al. 1995, Maina et al. 1997, Maina et al. 2001, Helmbacher et al. 2003) and tissue regeneration (Huh et al. 2004, Borowiak et al. 2004, Liu 2004, Chmielowiec et al. 2007). MET signaling is frequently aberrantly activated in cancer, through MET overexpression or activating MET mutations (Schmidt et al. 1997, Pennacchietti et al. 2003, Smolen et al. 2006, Bertotti et al. 2009).<br>Considerable progress has recently been made in the development of HGF-MET inhibitors in cancer therapy.

    8851162: '''The mammalian Golgi consists of at least three biochemically distinct cisternae, cis-, medial- and trans (reviewed in Szul and Sztul, 2011; Day et al, 2013). The structure and function of the Golgi are tightly interconnected, such that proteins that are required for protein transport through the Golgi are often also required for the organization of the Golgi stacks, and vice versa (reviewed in Liu and Storrie, 2012; Liu and Storrie, 2015; Chia and Gleeson, 2014; Munro, 2011). Newly synthesized proteins from the ER and ERGIC are received at the cis face of the Golgi and flow through to the trans-Golgi before being released to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) for further secretion to the endolysosomal system, plasma membrane or extracellular region.  Retrograde flow from the trans- to cis-cisternae moves endocytosed cargo from the extracellular region, the plasma membrane and the endolysosomal system back towards the ER. Intra-Golgi retrograde traffic also returns resident Golgi proteins to their appropriate cisternae, in this way facilitating cisternal remodeling or maturation (reviewed in Boncompain and Perez, 2013; Day et al, 2013).  Intra-Golgi traffic in both directions is mediated by COPI carriers, with specificity of transport being determined at least in part by the complement of SNAREs, RABs and tethering proteins involved (reviewed in Szul and Sztul, 2011; Spang 2013; Willet et al, 2013; Chia and Gleeson, 2014).''',
    622309: '''In contrast to NOD1/2 some NLRPs function as large macromolecular complexes called 'Inflammasomes'. These multiprotein platforms control activation of the cysteinyl aspartate protease caspase-1 and thereby the subsequent cleavage of pro-interleukin 1B (pro-IL1B) into the active proinflammatory cytokine IL1B. Activation of caspase-1 is essential for production of IL1B and IL18, which respectively bind and activate the IL1 receptor (IL1R) and IL18 receptor (IL18R) complexes. IL1R and IL18R activate NFkappaB and other signaling cascades.<br><br>As the activation of inflammasomes leads to caspase-1 activation, inflammasomes can be considered an upstream step of the IL1R and IL18R signaling cascades, linking intracellular pathogen sensing to immune response pathways mediated by Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs). Monocytes and macrophages do not express pro-IL1B until stimulated, typically by TLRs (Franchi et al. 2009). The resulting pro-IL1B is not converted to IL1B unless a second stimulus activates an inflammasome. This requirement for two distinct stimuli allows tight regulation of IL1B/IL18 production, necessary because excessive IL-1B production is associated with numerous inflammatory diseases such as  gout and rheumatoid arthritis (Masters et al. 2009).<br><br>There are at least four subtypes of the inflammasome, characterized by the NLRP. In addition the protein AIM2 can form an inflammasome. All activate caspase-1. NLRP1 (NALP1), NLRP3 (Cryopyrin, NALP3), IPAF (CARD12, NLRC4) and AIM2 inflammasomes all have clear physiological roles in vivo. NLRP2, NLRP6, NLRP7, NLRP10 and NLRP12 have been demonstrated to modulate caspase-1 activity in vitro but the significance of this is unclear (Mariathasan and Monack, 2007).<br><br>NLRP3 and AIM2 bind the protein 'apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD' (ASC, also called PYCARD), via a PYD-PYD domain interaction. This in turn recruits procaspase-1 through a CARD-CARD interaction. NLRP1 and IPAF contain CARD domains and can bind procaspase-1 directly, though both are stimulated by ASC. Oligomerization of NLRPs is believed to bring procaspases into close proximity, leading to 'induced proximity' auto-activation (Boatright et al. 2003). This leads to formation of the active caspase tetramer. NLRPs are generally considered to be cytoplasmic proteins, but there is evidence for cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of the family member CIITA (LeibundGut-Landmann et al. 2004) and tissue/cell dependent NALP1 expression in the nucleus of neurons and lymphocytes (Kummer et al. 2007); the significance of this remains unclear.

    1474281: '''Collagen is a family of at least 29 structural proteins derived from over 40 human genes (Myllyharju & Kivirikko 2004). It is the main component of connective tissue, and the most abundant protein in mammals making up about 25% to 35% of whole-body protein content. A defining feature of collagens is the formation of trimeric left-handed polyproline II-type helical collagenous regions. The packing within these regions is made possible by the presence of the smallest amino acid, glycine, at every third residue, resulting in a repeating motif Gly-X-Y where X is often proline (Pro) and Y often 4-hydroxyproline (4Hyp). Gly-Pro-Hyp is the most common triplet in collagen (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Collagen peptide chains also have non-collagenous domains, with collagen subclasses having common chain structures. Collagen fibrils are mostly found in fibrous tissues such as tendon, ligament and skin. Other forms of collagen are abundant in cornea, cartilage, bone, blood vessels, the gut, and intervertebral disc. In muscle tissue, collagen is a major component of the endomysium, constituting up to 6% of muscle mass. Gelatin, used in food and industry, is collagen that has been irreversibly hydrolyzed.

On the basis of their fibre architecture in tissues, the genetically distinct collagens have been divided into subgroups. Group 1 collagens have uninterrupted triple-helical domains of about 300 nm, forming large extracellular fibrils. They are referred to as the fibril-forming collagens, consisting of collagens types I, II, III, V, XI, XXIV and XXVII.  Group 2 collagens are types IV and VII, which have extended triple helices (>350 nm) with imperfections in the Gly-X-Y repeat sequences. Group 3 are the short-chain collagens. These have two subgroups. Group 3A have continuous triple-helical domains (type VI, VIII and X). Group 3B have interrupted triple-helical domains, referred to as the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT collagens, Shaw & Olsen 1991). FACITs include collagen IX, XII, XIV, XVI, XIX, XX, XXI, XXII and XXVI plus the transmembrane collagens (XIII, XVII, XXIII and XXV) and the multiple triple helix domains and interruptions (Multiplexin) collagens XV and XVIII (Myllyharju & Kivirikko 2004).  The non-collagenous domains of collagens have regulatory functions; several are biologically active when cleaved from the main peptide chain. Fibrillar collagen peptides all have a large triple helical domain (COL1) bordered by N and C terminal extensions, called the N- and C-propeptides, which are cleaved prior to formation of the collagen fibril. The intact form is referred to as a collagen propeptide, not procollagen, which is used to refer to the trimeric triple-helical precursor of collagen before the propeptides are removed. The C-propeptide, also called the NC1 domain, directs chain association during assembly of the procollagen molecule from its three constituent alpha chains (Hulmes 2002).<br><br>Fibril forming collagens are the most familiar and best studied subgroup. Collagen fibres are aggregates or bundles of collagen fibrils, which are themselves polymers of tropocollagen complexes, each consisting of three polypeptide chains known as alpha chains. Tropocollagens are considered the subunit of larger collagen structures. They are approximately 300 nm long and 1.5 nm in diameter, with a left-handed triple-helical structure, which becomes twisted into a right-handed coiled-coil 'super helix' in the collagen fibril. Tropocollagens in the extracellular space polymerize spontaneously with regularly staggered ends (Hulmes 2002). In fibrillar collagens the molecules are staggered by about 67 nm, a unit known as D that changes depending upon the hydration state. Each D-period contains slightly more than four collagen molecules so that every D-period repeat of the microfibril has a region containing five molecules in cross-section, called the 'overlap', and a region containing only four molecules, called the 'gap'. The triple-helices are arranged in a hexagonal or quasi-hexagonal array in cross-section, in both the gap and overlap regions (Orgel et al. 2006). Collagen molecules cross-link covalently to each other via lysine and hydroxylysine side chains. These cross-links are unusual, occuring only in collagen and elastin, a related protein.<br><br>The macromolecular structures of collagen are diverse. Several group 3 collagens associate with larger collagen fibers, serving as molecular bridges which stabilize the organization of the extracellular matrix. Type IV collagen is arranged in an interlacing network within the dermal-epidermal junction and vascular basement membranes. Type VI collagen forms distinct microfibrils called beaded filaments. Type VII collagen forms anchoring fibrils. Type VIII and X collagens form hexagonal networks. Type XVII collagen is a component of hemidesmosomes where it is complexed wtih alpha6Beta4 integrin, plectin, and laminin-332 (de Pereda et al. 2009). Type XXIX collagen has been recently reported to be a putative epidermal collagen with highest expression in suprabasal layers (Soderhall et al. 2007). Collagen fibrils/aggregates arranged in varying combinations and concentrations in different tissues provide specific tissue properties. In bone, collagen triple helices lie in a parallel, staggered array with 40 nm gaps between the ends of the tropocollagen subunits, which probably serve as nucleation sites for the deposition of  crystals of the mineral component, hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) with some phosphate. Collagen structure affects cell-cell and cell-matrix communication, tissue construction in growth and repair, and is changed in development and disease (Sweeney et al. 2006, Twardowski et al. 2007). A single collagen fibril can be heterogeneous along its axis, with significantly different mechanical properties in the gap and overlap regions, correlating with the different molecular organizations in these regions (Minary-Jolandan & Yu 2009).''',
    5635819: '''Activation of the transmembrane protein SMO in response to Hh stimulation is a major control point in the Hh signaling pathway (reviewed in Ayers and Therond, 2010; Jiang and Hui, 2008). In the absence of ligand, SMO is inhibited in an unknown manner by the Hh receptor PTCH. PTCH regulates SMO in a non-stoichiometric manner and there is little evidence that endogenous PTCH and SMO interact directly (Taipale et al, 2002; reviewed in Huangfu and Anderson, 2006). PTCH may regulate SMO activity by controlling the flux of sterol-related SMO agonists and/or antagonists, although this has not been fully substantiated (Khaliullina et al, 2009; reviewed in Rohatgi and Scott, 2007; Briscoe and Therond, 2013).<br><br>PTCH-mediated inhibition of SMO is relieved upon ligand stimulation of PTCH, but the mechanisms for this relief are again unknown. SMO and PTCH appear to have opposing localizations in both the 'off' and 'on' state, with PTCH exiting and SMO entering the cilium upon Hh pathway activation (Denef et al, 2000; Rohatgi et al, 2007; reviewed in Goetz and Anderson, 2010; Hui and Angers, 2011). Activation of SMO involves a conserved phosphorylation-mediated conformational change in the C-terminal tails that destabilizes an intramolecular interaction and promotes the interaction between adjacent tails in the SMO dimer.  In Drosophila, this phosphorylation is mediated by PKA and CK1, while in vertebrates it appears to involve ADRBK1/GRK2 and CSNK1A1. Sequential phosphorylations along multiple serine and threonine motifs in the SMO C-terminal tail appear to allow a graded response to Hh ligand concentration in both flies and vertebrates (Zhao et al, 2007; Chen et al, 2010; Chen et al, 2011).  In flies, Smo C-terminal tail phosphorylation promotes an association with the Hedgehog signaling complex (HSC) through interaction with the scaffolding kinesin-2 like protein Cos2, activating the Fu kinase and ultimately releasing uncleaved Ci from the complex (Zhang et al, 2005; Ogden et al, 2003; Lum et al, 2003; reviewed in Mukhopadhyay and Rohatgi, 2014). In vertebrates, SMO C-terminal tail phosphorylation and conformational change is linked to its KIF7-dependent ciliary accumulation  (Chen et al, 2011; Zhao et al, 2007; Chen et al, 2010).  In the cilium, SMO is restricted to a transition-zone proximal region known as the EvC zone (Yang et al, 2012; Blair et al, 2011; Pusapati et al, 2014; reviewed in Eggenschwiler 2012). Both SMO phosphorylation and its ciliary localization are required to promote the Hh-dependent dissociation of the GLI:SUFU complex, ultimately allowing full-length GLI transcription factors to translocate to the nucleus to activate Hh-responsive genes (reviewed in Briscoe and Therond, 2013).<br><br><br>''',

    8941298: '''In addition to regulating osteoblast differentiation, RUNX2 regulates skeletal development by regulating maturation of chondrocytes (Takeda et al. 2001).

Expression of the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR1) and Indian hedgehog (IHH) are hallmarks of chondrocyte maturation. Mice that are double knockouts for Runx2 and Runx3 show a complete absence of chondrocyte maturation and, hence, aberrant limb growth.

A central part in this regulation is played by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), a neutral lipase abundant in adipocytes and skeletal and cardiac muscle, but also abundant in ovarian and adrenal tissue, where it mediates cholesterol ester hydrolysis, yielding cholesterol for steroid biosynthesis. The hormones to which it is sensitive include catecholamines (e.g., epinephrine), ACTH, and glucagon, all of which trigger signaling cascades that lead to its phosphorylation and activation, and insulin, which sets off events leading to its dephosphorylation and inactivation (Holm et al. 2000; Kraemer and Shen 2002).<p>The processes of triacylglycerol and cholesterol ester hydrolysis are also regulated by subcellular compartmentalization: these lipids are packaged in cytosolic particles and the enzymes responsible for their hydrolysis, and perhaps for additional steps in their metabolism, are organized at the surfaces of these particles (e.g., Brasaemle et al. 2004). This organization is dynamic: the inactive form of HSL is not associated with the particles, but is translocated there after being phosphorylated. Conversely, perilipin, a major constituent of the particle surface, appears to block access of enzymes to the lipids within the particle; its phosphorylation allows greater access. <p>Here, HSL-mediated triacylglycerol hydrolysis is described as a pathway containing twelve reactions. The first six of these involve activation: phosphorylation of HSL, dimerization of HSL, disruption of CGI-58:perilipin complexes at the surfaces of cytosolic lipid particles, phosphorylation of perilipin, association of phosphorylated HSL with FABP, and translocation of HSL from the cytosol to the surfaces of lipid particles. The next four reactions are the hydrolysis reactions themselves: the hydrolysis of cholesterol esters, and the successive removal of three fatty acids from triacylglycerol.

These microRNAs are altered in cancer and can account for changes in PTEN levels (Meng et al. 2007, Xiao et al. 2008, Yang et al. 2008, Huse et al. 2009, Kim et al. 2010, Poliseno, Salmena, Riccardi et al. 2010, Cai et al. 2013). In addition, coding and non-coding RNAs can prevent microRNAs from binding to PTEN mRNA. These RNAs are termed competing endogenous RNAs or ceRNAs. Transcripts of the pseudogene PTENP1 and mRNAs transcribed from SERINC1, VAPA and CNOT6L genes exhibit this activity (Poliseno, Salmena, Zhang et al. 2010, Tay et al. 2011, Tay et al. 2014).<p>PTEN can translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus after undergoing monoubiquitination. PTEN's ability to localize to the nucleus contributes to its tumor suppressive role (Trotman et al. 2007). The ubiquitin protease USP7 (HAUSP) targets monoubiquitinated PTEN in the nucleus, resulting in PTEN deubiquitination and nuclear exclusion. PML, via an unknown mechanism that involves USP7- and PML-interacting protein DAXX, inhibits USP7-mediated deubiquitination of PTEN, thus promoting PTEN nuclear localization. Disruption of PML function in acute promyelocytic leukemia, through a chromosomal translocation that results in expression of a fusion protein PML-RARA, leads to aberrant PTEN localization (Song et al. 2008).<p>Several ubiquitin ligases, including NEDD4, WWP2, STUB1 (CHIP), RNF146, XIAP and MKRN1, polyubiquitinate PTEN and target it for proteasome-mediated degradation (Wang et al. 2007, Van Themsche et al. 2009, Ahmed et al. 2011, Maddika et al. 2011, Lee et al. 2015, Li et al. 2015). The ubiquitin proteases USP13 and OTUD3, frequently down-regulated in breast cancer, remove polyubiquitin chains from PTEN, thus preventing its degradation and increasing its half-life (Zhang et al. 2013, Yuan et al. 2015). The catalytic activity of PTEN is negatively regulated by PREX2 binding (Fine et al. 2009, Hodakoski et al. 2014) and TRIM27-mediated ubiquitination (Lee et al. 2013), most likely through altered PTEN conformation.<p>In addition to ubiquitination, PTEN also undergoes SUMOylation (Gonzalez-Santamaria et al. 2012, Da Silva Ferrada et al. 2013, Lang et al. 2015, Leslie et al. 2016). SUMOylation of the C2 domain of PTEN may regulate PTEN association with the plasma membrane (Shenoy et al. 2012) as well as nuclear localization of PTEN (Bassi et al. 2013, Collaud et al. 2016). PIASx-alpha, a splicing isorom of E3 SUMO-protein ligase PIAS2 has been implicated in PTEN SUMOylation (Wang et al. 2014). SUMOylation of PTEN may be regulated by activated AKT (Lin et al. 2016). Reactions describing PTEN SUMOylation will be annotated when mechanistic details become available.<p>Phosphorylation affects the stability and activity of PTEN. FRK tyrosine kinase (RAK) phosphorylates PTEN on tyrosine residue Y336, which increases PTEN half-life by inhibiting NEDD4-mediated polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PTEN. FRK-mediated phosphorylation also increases PTEN enzymatic activity (Yim et al. 2009). Casein kinase II (CK2) constitutively phosphorylates the C-terminal tail of PTEN on serine and threonine residues S370, S380, T382, T383 and S385. CK2-mediated phosphorylation increases PTEN protein stability (Torres and Pulido 2001) but results in ~30% reduction in PTEN lipid phosphatase activity (Miller et al. 2002).<p>PTEN localization and activity are affected by acetylation of its lysine residues (Okumura et al. 2006, Ikenoue et al. 2008, Meng et al. 2016). PTEN can undergo oxidation, which affects its function, but the mechanism is poorly understood (Tan et al. 2015, Shen et al. 2015, Verrastro et al. 2016).''',

Mitochondrial RNase P, which is completely distinct from nuclear RNase P in having different protein subunits and no RNA component, cleaves at the 5' ends of tRNAs. RNase Z, an isoform of ELAC2 in mitochondria, cleaves at the 3' ends of tRNAs. (A different isoform of ELAC2 serves as RNase Z in the nucleus.) Unknown nucleases make additional cleavages near the 5' end of MT-CO3, the 5' end of CO1, the 5' end of CYB, and the 3' end of ND6. TRNT1 (CCA-adding enzyme) then post-transcriptionally polymerizes the universal acceptor sequence CCA onto the 3' ends of the cleaved tRNAs.

Deficient NER processes have been identified from the cells of cancer-prone patients with different variants of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), trichothiodystrophy (TTD), and Cockayne's syndrome. The XP cells exhibit an ultraviolet radiation hypersensitivity that leads to a hypermutability response to UV, offering a direct connection between deficient NER, increased mutation rate, and cancer. While the NER pathway in prokaryotes is unique, the pathway utilized in yeast and higher eukaryotes is highly conserved.<BR>NER is involved in the repair of bulky adducts in DNA, such as UV-induced photo lesions (both 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PPDs) and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs)), as well as chemical adducts formed from exposure to aflatoxin, benzopyrene and other genotoxic agents.

Both full-length and cleaved C-terminus of TLR9 bind CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides, however it has been proposed that only the processed receptor is functional.<p> Although similar cleavage of TLR3 has been reported by Ewald et al 2011, other studies demonstrated that the N-terminal region of TLR3 ectodomain was implicated in ligand binding, thus TLR3 may function as a full-length receptor (Liu L et al 2008, Tokisue T et al 2008).<p> There are no data on TLR8 processing, although the cell biology of TLR8 is probably similar to TLR9 and TLR7 (Gibbard RJ et al 2006, Wei T et al 2009).''',

DNA helicases ERCC2 (XPD) and ERCC3 (XPB) are subunits of the TFIIH complex. ERCC2 unwinds the DNA around the damage in concert with the ATPase activity of ERCC3, creating an open bubble (Coin et al. 2007). Simultaneously, the presence of the damage is verified by XPA (Camenisch et al. 2006). The recruitment of XPA is partially regulated by PARP1 and/or PARP2 (King et al. 2012).<p>Two DNA endonucleases, ERCC5 (XPG) and the complex of ERCC1 and ERCC4 (XPF), are recruited to the open bubble structure to form the incision complex that will excise the damaged oligonucleotide from the affected DNA strand (Dunand-Sauthier et al. 2005, Zotter et al. 2006, Riedl et al. 2003, Tsodikov et al. 2007, Orelli et al. 2010).

Binding of the RUNX2:CBFB complex to the BGLAP gene promoter is increased when RUNX2 is phosphorylated on serine residue S451 (Wee et al. 2002). Osteocalcin, a bone-derived hormone, is one of the most abundant non-collagenous proteins of the bone extracellular matrix (reviewed in Karsenty and Olson 2016). Association of the activated androgen receptor (AR) with RUNX2 prevents binding of RUNX2 to the BGLAP promoter (Baniwal et al. 2009). When YAP1, tyrosine phosphorylated by SRC and/or YES1, binds to RUNX2 at the BGLAP gene promoter, transcription of the BGLAP gene is inhibited (Zaidi et al. 2004). Signaling by SRC is known to inhibit osteoblast differentiation (Marzia et al. 2000).<br>Simultaneous binding of RUNX2 and SP7 (Osterix, also known as OSX) to adjacent RUNX2 and SP7 binding sites, respectively, in the UCMA promoter, synergistically activates UCMA transcription.

A great deal is known about the function of cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction and at ganglionic synapses, the actions of ACh in the central nervous system are not as well understood.  Acetylcholine is synthesized in nerve terminals from acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA) synthesized from glucose) and choline. This reaction is catalyzed by choline acetyltransferase (CAT). The presence of acetyltransferase in a neuron is thus a strong indication that ACh is used as one of its transmitters. Choline is present in plasma at a concentration of about 10 mM, and is taken up into cholinergic neurons by a high-affinity Na+/choline transporter. About 10,000 molecules of ACh are packaged into each neurotransmitter containing vesicle by a vesicular ACh transporter.''',
    6782753: '''DNA damage in transcribed strands of active genes is repaired through a specialized nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway known as transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). TC-NER impairment is the underlying cause of a severe hereditary disorder Cockayne syndrome, an autosomal recessive disease characterized by hypersensitivity to UV light.<BR>TC-NER is triggered by helix distorting lesions that block the progression of elongating RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II). Stalled RNA Pol II complex triggers the recruitment of ERCC6. ERCC6, commonly known as CSB (Cockayne syndrome protein B) recruits ERCC8, commonly known as CSA (Cockayne syndrome protein A). ERCC8 has 7 WD repeat motifs and is part of the ubiquitin ligase complex that also includes DDB1, CUL4A or CUL4B and RBX1. The ERCC8 ubiquitin ligase complex is one of the key regulators of TC-NER that probably exerts its role by ubiquitinating one or more factors involved in this repair process, including the RNA Pol II complex and ERCC6.<BR>In addition to RNA Pol II, ERCC6 and the ERCC8 complex, the transcription elongation factor TFIIH, which is also involved in global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER), is recruited to sites of TC-NER. The TC-NER pre-incision complex also includes XPA, XAB2 complex, TCEA1 (TFIIS), HMGN1, UVSSA in complex with USP7, and EP300 (p300). XPA probably contributes to the assembly and stability of the pre-incision complex, similar to its role in GG-NER. The XAB2 complex is involved in pre-mRNA splicing and may modulate the structure of the nascent mRNA hybrid with template DNA through its RNA-DNA helicase activity, allowing proper processing of DNA damage. TCEA1 may be involved in RNA Pol II backtracking, which allows repair proteins to gain access to the damage site. It also facilitates trimming of the 3' end of protruding nascent mRNA from the stalled RNA Pol II, enabling recovery of RNA synthesis after repair.<p>Deubiquitinating activity of the UVSSA:USP7 complex is needed for ERCC6 stability at repair sites. Non-histone nucleosomal binding protein HMGN1 and histone acetyltransferase p300 (EP300) remodel the chromatin around the damaged site, thus facilitating repair.<p>Dual incision of the lesion-containing oligonucleotide from the affected DNA strand is performed by two DNA endonucleases, the ERCC1:ERCC4 (ERCC1:XPF) complex and ERCC5 (XPG), which also participate in GG-NER.

    6782756: '''Formation of TC-NER pre-incision complex is initiated when the RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) complex stalls at a DNA damage site. The stalling is caused by misincorporation of a ribonucleotide opposite to a damaged base (Brueckner et al. 2007). Cockayne syndrome protein B (ERCC6, CSB) binds stalled RNA Pol II and recruits Cockayne syndrome protein A (ERCC8, CSA). ERCC8 is part of an ubiquitin ligase complex that also contains DDB1, CUL4A or CUL4B and RBX1. This complex is implicated in the regulation of TC-NER progression probably by ubiquitinating one or more factors involved in this pathway, which may include RNA Pol II and ERCC6 at the later stages of repair (Bregman et al. 1996, Fousteri et al. 2006, Groisman et al. 2006). XPA is recruited to the TC-NER site through its interaction with the TFIIH complex (Furuta et al. 2002, Ziani et al. 2014). The XAB2 complex, which probably regulates the accessibility of the DNA damage site through its RNA-DNA helicase activity, binds the TC-NER site via the interaction of its XAB2 subunit with RNA Pol II, ERCC6, ERCC8 and XPA (Nakatsu et al. 2000, Sollier et al. 2014). TCEA1 (TFIIS) is a transcription elongation factor that may facilitate backtracking of the stalled RNA Pol II, enabling access of repair proteins to the DNA damage site and promotes partial digestion of the 3' protruding end of the nascent mRNA transcript by the backtracked RNA Pol II, allowing resumption of RNA synthesis after damage removal (Donahue et al. 1994). Access to DNA damage site is also facilitated by chromatin remodelers HMGN1 (recruited to the TC-NER site through RNA Pol II and ERCC8-dependent manner) and histone acetyltransferase p300 (EP300), recruited to the TC-NER site through ERCC6-dependent manner (Birger et al. 2003, Fousteri et al. 2006). UVSSA protein interacts with ubiquitinated ERCC6 and RNA Pol II, recruiting ubiquitin protease USP7 to the TC-NER site and promoting ERCC6 stabilization (Nakazawa et al. 2012, Schwertman et al. 2012, Zhang et al. 2012, Fei and Chen 2012).''',

STAT3 may also bind to activated MET indirectly through GAB1, but this interaction has not been studied in detail. Activated MET induces phosphorylation of STAT3 at Y705, triggering STAT3 dimerization and nuclear translocation (Schaper et al. 1997, Boccaccio et al. 1998, Zhang et al. 2002, Cramer et al. 2005). Endocytosis of MET and interaction with STAT3 at endosomes may be required for sustained STAT3 phosphorylation in response to HGF stimulation (Kermorgant and Parker 2008). Activated SRC may also contribute to phosphorylation of STAT3 at Y705. STAT3 may promote HGF transcription in a SRC-dependent way, but this autocrine HGF loop may be limited to breast cancer cells (Wojcik et al. 2006, Sam et al. 2007). MET-mediated activation of STAT3 is implicated in anchorage independent cell growth and invasiveness downstream of HGF (Zhang et al. 2002, Cramer et al. 2005).

In addition to their antimicrobial properties, cathelicidin and several defensins show receptor-mediated chemotactic activity for immune cells such as monocytes, T cells or immature DCs, induce cytokine production by monocytes and epithelial cells, modulate angiogenesis and stimulate wound healing (Yang et al. 1999, 2000, 2004, Rehaume & Hancock 2008, Yeung et al. 2011).''',

Netrin first stimulates its receptor DCC, resulting in the activation of the enzyme phospholipase C.

HIV-1 reverse transcription takes place in the cytosol of a newly infected host cell and involves multiple steps of RNA synthesis and degradation of the RNA strand of RNA:DNA duplexes mediated by the HIV-1 RT protein, as well as two template switches, to yield a DNA duplex colinear with the viral genomic RNA but with additional Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) sequence motifs at both ends (Telesnitsky and Goff 1997; Jonckheere et al. 2000).<p>HIV-1 RT has two catalytic activities essential for transcription of a DNA duplex copy of the viral genomic RNA: a reverse transcriptase activity and an RNase H activity.

    167728: '''Expression of the integrated HIV-1 provirus is dependent on the host cell Pol II transcription machinery, but is regulated in critical ways by HIV-1 Tat and Rev proteins. The long terminal repeats (LTR) located at either end of the proviral DNA contain regulatory sequences that recruit cellular transcription factors. The U3 region of the 5' LTR contains numerous cis-acting elements that regulate Pol II-mediated transcription initiation. The full-length transcript, which encodes nine genes, functions as an mRNA and is packaged as genomic RNA.  Smaller (subgenomic) viral mRNAs are generated by alternative splicing. The activities of Tat and Rev create two phases of gene expression (see Karn 1999; Cullen 1991). The Tat protein is an RNA specific trans-activator of LTR-mediated transcription. Association of Tat with TAR, a RNA stem-loop within the RNA leader sequence, is required for efficient elongation of the HIV-1 transcript.  In the early phase of viral transcription, a multiply-spliced set of mRNAs is generated, producing the transcripts of the regulatory proteins, Tat, Rev, and Nef. In the late phase, Rev regulates nuclear export of HIV-1 mRNAs, repressing expression of the early regulatory mRNAs and promoting expression of viral structural proteins. Nuclear export of the unspliced and partially spliced late HIV-1 transcripts that encode the structural proteins requires the association of Rev with a cis-acting RNA sequence in the transcripts (Rev Response Element, RRE).''',

    5619506: '''Hox genes encode proteins that contain the DNA-binding homeobox motif and control early patterning of segments in the embryo as well as later events in development (reviewed in Rezsohazy et al. 2015). Mammals have 39 Hox genes arrayed in 4 linear clusters, with each cluster containing 9 to 11 genes. Based on homologies, the genes have been assigned to 13 paralogous groups. The nomenclature of Hox genes uses a letter to indicate the cluster and a number to indicate the paralog group. For example, HOXA4 is the gene in cluster A that is most similar with genes of paralog group 4 from other clusters. <br>One of the most striking aspects of mammalian Hox gene function is the mechanism of their activation during embryogenesis: the order of genes in a cluster correlates with the timing and location of their activation such that genes at the 3' end of a cluster are activated first and genes at the 5' end of a cluster are activated last. (5' and 3' refer to the transcriptional orientation of the genes in the cluster.) Because development of segments of the embryo proceeds from anterior to posterior this means that the anterior boundaries of expression of 3' genes are more anterior (rostral) and the anterior boundaries of expression of 5' genes are more posterior (caudal). 
Expression of HOX genes initiates in the posterior primitive streak at the beginning of gastrulation at approximately E7.5 in mouse. As gastrulation proceeds, further 5' genes are sequentially activated and they too undergo the same chromatin changes and migration. After formation of the axis of the embryo, similar waves of activation of HOXA and HOXD clusters occur in developing limbs beginning at about E9. Retinoids, especially all trans retinoic acid (atRA), participate in initiating the process via retinoid receptors. Other factors such as FGFs and Wnt, also regulate Hox expression. After activation, Hox genes participate in maintaining their own expression (autoregulation), activating later, 5' Hox genes, and repressing prior, 3' Hox genes (crossregulation). Differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells and embryonic stem cells in response to retinoic acid is used to model the process in vitro (reviewed in Gudas et al. 2013). <br>Activation of Hox genes is accompanied by a change from bivalent chromatin to euchromatin (reviewed in Soshnikova and Duboule 2009). Bivalent chromatin has extensive methylation of lysine-9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3), a repressive mark, with interspersed punctate regions of methylation of lysine-4 on histone H3 (H3K4me2, H3K4me3), an activating mark. Euchromatization initiates at the 3' ends of clusters and proceeds towards the 5' ends, with the euchromatin migrating to an active region of the nucleus (reviewed in Montavon and Duboule 2013). This change in chromatin reflects a loss of H3K27me3 and a gain of H3K4me2,3. Polycomb repressive complexes bind H3K27me3 and are responsible for maintenance of repression, KDM6A and KDM6B histone demethylases remove H3K27me3, and members of the trithorax family of histone methylases (KMT2A, KMT2C, KMT2D) methylate H3K4.''',

During G1 phase of the cell cycle, cyclin A is synthesized and associates with Cdk2. After forming in the cytoplasm, the Cyclin A:Cdk2 complexes are translocated to the nucleus (Jackman et al.,2002).  Prior to S phase entry, the activity of Cyclin A:Cdk2 complexes is negatively regulated through Tyr 15 phosphorylation of  Cdk2 (Gu et al., 1995) and also by the association of the cyclin kinase inhibitors (CKIs), p27 and p21. Phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) is required for the activation of the CDK2 kinase activity (Aprelikova et al., 1995). The entry into S phase is promoted by the removal of inhibitory Tyr 15 phosphates from the Cdk2 subunit of Cyclin A:Cdk2 complex by the Cdc25 phosphatases (Blomberg and Hoffmann, 1999) and by SCF(Skp2)-mediated degradation of p27/p21 (see Ganoth et al., 2001). 
While Cdk2 is thought to play a primary role in regulating entry into S phase, recent evidence indicates that Cdk1 is equally capable of promoting entry into S phase and the initiation of DNA replication (see  Bashir and Pagano, 2005). Thus, Cdk1 complexes may also play a significant role at this point in the cell cycle.''',

The ubiquitin-26S proteasome system plays a central role in the generation of these class I MHC antigens. <br>Ubiquitination is the mechanism of adding ubiquitin to lysine residues on substrate protein leading to the formation of a  polyubiquitinated substrate. This process involves three classes of enzyme, an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Polyubiquitination through lysine-48 (K48) generally targets the substrate protein for proteasomal destruction. The protease responsible for the degradation of K48-polyubiquitinated proteins is the 26S proteasome. This proteasome is a two subunit protein complex composed of the 20S (catalytic core) and 19S (regulatory) proteasome complexes.

Sulphoxide formation can be reversed by the action of the methionine sulphoxide reductase system (MSR) which catalyses the reduction of MetO to Met (Brot et al. 1981). This repair uses one ROS equivalent, so MSR proteins can act as catalytic antioxidants, removing ROS (Levine et al. 1996). Methionine oxidation results in a mixture of methionine (S)-S- and (R)-S-oxides of methionine, diastereomers which are reduced by MSRA and MSRB, respectively. MSRA can reduce both free and protein-based methionine-(S)-S-oxide, whereas MSRB is specific for protein-based methionine-(R)-S-oxide. Mammals typically have only one gene encoding MSRA, but at least three genes encoding MSRBs (Hansel et al. 2005). Although structurally distinct, MRSA and MRSB share a common three-step catalytic mechanism. In the first step, the MSR catalytic cysteine residue interacts with the MetO substrate, which leads to product release and formation of the sulfenic acid. In the second step, an intramolecular disulfide bridge is formed between the catalytic cysteine and the regenerating cysteine. In the final step, the disulfide bridge is reduced by an electron donor, the NADPH-dependent thioredoxin/TR system, leading to the regeneration of the MSR active site (Boschi-Muller et al. 2008).<br><br>Beta-linked isoaspartyl (isoAsp) peptide bonds can arise spontaneously via succinimide-linked deamidation of asparagine (Asn) or dehydration of aspartate (Asp). Protein-L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase (PCMT1, PIMT EC 2.1.1.77) transfers the methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to the alpha side-chain carboxyl group of L-isoaspartyl and D-aspartatyl amino acids. The resulting methyl ester undergoes spontaneous transformation to L-succinimide, which spontaneously hydrolyses to generates L-aspartyl residues or L-isoaspartyl residues (Knorre et al. 2009). This repair process helps to maintain overall protein integrity.''',

    8941443: '''RUNX2 (CBFA1 or AML3) transcription factor, similar to other RUNX family members, RUNX1 and RUNX3, can function in complex with CBFB (CBF-beta) (Kundu et al. 2002, Yoshida et al. 2002, Otto et al. 2002). RUNX2 mainly regulates transcription of genes involved in skeletal development (reviewed in Karsenty 2008). RUNX2 is involved in development of both intramembraneous and endochondral bones through regulation of osteoblast differentiation and chondrocyte maturation, respectively. RUNX2 stimulates transcription of the BGLAP gene (Ducy and Karsenty 1995, Ducy et al. 1997), which encodes Osteocalcin, a bone-derived hormone which is one of the most abundant non-collagenous proteins of the bone extracellular matrix (reviewed in Karsenty and Olson 2016). RUNX2 directly controls the expression of most genes associated with osteoblast differentiation and function (Sato et al. 1998, Ducy et al. 1999, Roce et al. 2005). RUNX2-mediated transcriptional regulation of several genes involved in GPCR (G protein coupled receptor) signaling is implicated in the control of growth of osteoblast progenitors (Teplyuk et al. 2009). RUNX2 promotes chondrocyte maturation by stimulating transcription of the IHH gene, encoding Indian hedgehog (Takeda et al. 2001, Yoshida et al. 2004). Germline loss-of-function mutations of the RUNX2 gene are associated with cleidocranial dysplasia syndrome (CCD), an autosomal skeletal disorder (reviewed in Jaruga et al. 2016). The function of RUNX2 is frequently disrupted in osteosarcoma (reviewed in Mortus et al. 2014). Vitamin D3 is implicated in regulation of transcriptional activity of the RUNX2:CBFB complex (Underwood et al. 2012).<p>RUNX2 expression is regulated by estrogen signaling, and RUNX2 is implicated in breast cancer development and metastasis (reviewed in Wysokinski et al. 2014). Besides estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRA) (Kammerer et al. 2013), RUNX2 transcription is also regulated by TWIST1 (Yang, Yang et al. 2011), glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) (Zhang et al. 2012), NKX3-2 (BAPX1) (Tribioli and Lufkin 1999, Lengner et al. 2005), DLX5 (Robledo et al. 2002, Lee et al. 2005) and MSX2 (Lee et al. 2005). RUNX2 can autoregulate, by directly inhibiting its own transcription (Drissi et al. 2000). Several E3 ubiquitin ligases target RUNX2 for proteasome-mediated degradation: FBXW7a (Kumar et al. 2015), STUB1 (CHIP) (Li et al. 2008), SMURF1 (Zhao et al. 2003, Yang et al. 2014), WWP1 (Jones et al. 2006), and SKP2 (Thacker et al. 2016). Besides formation of RUNX2:CBFB heterodimers, transcriptional activity of RUNX2 is regulated by binding to a number of other transcription factors, for example SOX9 (Zhou et al. 2006, TWIST1 (Bialek et al. 2004) and RB1 (Thomas et al. 2001).<p>RUNX2 regulates expression of several genes implicated in cell migration during normal development and bone metastasis of breast cancer cells. RUNX2 stimulates transcription of the ITGA5 gene, encoding Integrin alpha 5 (Li et al. 2016) and the ITGBL1 gene, encoding Integrin beta like protein 1 (Li et al. 2015). RUNX2 mediated transcription of the MMP13 gene, encoding Colagenase 3 (Matrix metalloproteinase 13), is stimulated by AKT mediated phosphorylation of RUNX2 (Pande et al. 2013). RUNX2 is implicated in positive regulation of AKT signaling by stimulating expression of AKT-activating TORC2 complex components MTOR and RICTOR, which may contribute to survival of breast cancer cells (Tandon et al. 2014).<p>RUNX2 inhibits CDKN1A transcription, thus preventing CDKN1A-induced cell cycle arrest. Phosphorylation of RUNX2 by CDK4 in response to high glucose enhances RUNX2-mediated repression of the CDKN1A gene in endothelial cells (Pierce et al. 2012). In mice, Runx2-mediated repression of Cdkn1a may contribute to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Kuo et al. 2009). RUNX2 can stimulate transcription of the LGALS3 gene, encoding Galectin-3 (Vladimirova et al. 2008, Zhang et al. 2009). Galectin 3 is expressed in myeloid progenitors and its levels increase during the maturation process (Le Marer 2000).<p>For a review of RUNX2 function, please refer to Long 2012 and Ito et al. 2015.

Subsequent studies established that the cellular PSIP1/LEDGF/p75 protein is important in this reaction. PSIP1/LEDGF/p75 binds tightly to HIV integrase, and also to chromatin. Knocking down PSIP1/LEDGF/p75 in cells resulted in several perturbations of integration targeting in vivo, including reduced integration in transcription units. Thus PSIP1/LEDGF/p75 has been hypothesized to act as a tethering factor that dictates at least in part the placement of HIV integration sites. <p>The integration target DNA is also expected to be coated with nucleosomes. Tests of integration into mononucleosomes in vitro have shown that wrapping integration target DNA actually boosts integration activity.

However, favored and disfavored primary sequences can be detected when many integration sites are aligned.

The manner by which this intermediate is subsequently repaired to yield the fully integrated provirus is unclear. For many parasitic DNA replication reactions, the parasite carries out reaction steps only up to a point that the host cannot easily reverse, forcing the host to complete the job (Bushman 2001; Craig et al. 2002). For retroviral integration, it is reasonable to infer that host DNA repair enzymes complete provirus formation. DNA gap repair enzymes are known to be involved in a variety of DNA repair pathways, so their recruitment to gaps at host-virus DNA junctions is readily envisioned. Consistent with this, known gap repair enzymes have been shown to act on model host-virus DNA junctions in vitro (Yoder and Bushman, 2000).''',

This has been found to be mediated by TLR7, as well as TLR8. Separate studies showed that imidazoquinoline compounds (e.g. imiquimod and R-848, low-molecular-weight immune response modifiers that can induce the synthesis of interferon-alpha) also exert their effects in a MyD88-dependent fashion independently through TLR7 and 8 (Heil et al. 2004).''',

    3248010: '''Three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is a DNase type III enzyme, which targets and digests unpaired nucleotides on ssDNA and dsDNA ends through a 3'to 5' exonuclease activity (Perrino FW et al. 1994; de Silva U et al. 2007; Lehtinen DA et al. 2008; Fye JM et al 2011). TREX1 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein, which is anchored to ER membrane via the C-terminal transmembrane domain (Chowdhury D et al. 2006; Richards A et al. 2007; Stetson DB et al. 2009). TREX1 has been implicated in innate immune responses against self (damaged or retrotransposons-derived DNA) and retroviral-derived DNA (Stetson DB et al. 2009; Yan N et al. 2010; Hasan M et al. 2012). TREX1 deficiency in human and mouse cells led to accumulation of cytosolic DNA which resulted in a continual activation of cytosolic DNA-sensors. In addition, cells lacking TREX1 function were less susceptible to infection with different types of RNA viruses (Yan N et al. 2010; Hasan M et al. 2012).Thus, the physiological role of the exonuclease TREX1 is to digest cytosolic host DNA to avoid autoimmunity. Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding human TREX1 are associated with several autoimmune diseases (Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS), familial chilblain lupus (FCL), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)) that result in increased levels of interferon and circulating antibodies to DNA (Crow YJ et al. 2006; Rice G et al. 2007; Lee-Kirsch MA et al. 2007). During infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or other RNA viruses, TREX1 activity may inhibit the innate immune responses by processing viral DNA generated during reverse transcription (Yan N et al. 2010; Hasan M et al. 2012). It's not yet known whether TREX1 is also involved in regulation of host responses to DNA viruses.<p>Detection of nucleic acids is known to launch signaling cascades leading to induction of type I interferons, which in turn orchestrate an immune response that involves the expression of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). It is interesting to note that interferon(IFN)-independent activation of a subset of ISGs was detected in mouse and human cells lacking functional TREX1 (Hasan M et al. 2012).  Hasan et al. have also observed that TREX1-deficiency resulted in an increased lysosomal compartment. Trex1 was found to control mTORC1 activity in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), which in turn negatively regulates translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) to the nucleus thereby controlling lysosomal biogenesis (Hasan M et al. 2012; Roczniak-Ferguson A et al. 2012). The authors linked the altered lysosomal compartment to innate immune responses by suggesting that lysosomal biogenesis (regulated by TFEB and mTORC1)  acted upstream of IFN-independent ISG expression (regulated by IRF3 and IRF7) (Hasan M et al. 2012).''',

Unlike most other Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs), flagellin does not undergo any posttranslational modifications that would distinguish it from cellular proteins. However, flagellin is extremely conserved at its amino- and carboxyl-termini, which presumably explains why it was selected as a ligand for innate immune recognition. TLR5 is expressed on epithelial cells as well as on macrophages and dendritic cells. Expression of TLR5 on intestinal epithelium is polarized such that TLR5 is expressed only on the basolateral side of the cell, as pathogenic but not commensal microbes cross the epithelial barrier. This ensures that innate immune responses are confined to pathogenic but not commensal microbes (Paul 2004; Hayashi et al. 2001; Gewirtz et al. 2001).''',

    167824: '''Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are members of the mitochondrial transport carrier family, and have been implicated in a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions. Physiological conditions include thermogenesis, fatty acid metabolism and protection against free radicals and ageing; pathological conditions include involvement in obesity, diabetes and degenerative, neurological and immunological diseases.<br><br>The UCPs share general structural features with the other mitochondrial transport carriers. They have a tripartite structure, consisting of three homologous sequence repeats of approximately 100 residues. The carriers also have a signature motif, which is repeated in all members of the family and in all three repeats. The transmembrane arrangement of UCPs is 6 alpha-helix regions (2 regions per repeat) spanning the lipid bilayer with the amino and carboxyl termini facing the cytosolic side. The crystal structure of one member of the family, the adenine nucleotide translocase, is known, and UCPs can be successfully folded into this structure to indicate their probable 3D arrangement (Pebay-Peyroula et al. 2003, Kunji 2004, Esteves & Brand 2005).

The most studied member of the family, UCP1, catalyzes adaptive thermogenesis (i.e. heat generation) in mammalian brown adipose tissue. It does so by promoting a leak of protons through the mitochondrial inner membrane, which uncouples ATP production from substrate oxidation, leading to fast oxygen consumption and ultimately to heat production. The thermogenic activity of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue plays an important role when the organism needs extra heat, e.g. during cold weather conditions (for small rodents), the cold stress of birth or arousal from hibernation. UCP1 homologs have been found in lower vertebrates such as fish, where their role is unclear (Cannon & Nedergaard 2004, Jastroch et al. 2005).

The proton conductance of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue is tightly controlled. It is strongly inhibited by physiological concentrations of purine nucleotides. This inhibition is overcome by fatty acids, which are released from intracellular triacylglycerol stores following adrenergic activation in response to cold or overfeeding. Other activators include superoxide, retinoic acid, the retinoid 4-[(E)-2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetra-methyl-2-naphtalenyl)-1-propenyl]benzoic acid (TTNPB) and reactive alkenals, such as hydroxynonenal. 

UCP2 and UCP3 have high amino acid sequence homology to UCP1 (59 and 57% amino-acid identity respectively). UCP2 has been identified in lung, spleen, pancreatic beta-cells and kidney, whereas UCP3 is found in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Homologs of UCP2 and UCP3 are found in marsupials, birds, fish and plants. 

Despite a low level of sequence homology with UCP1-3, UCP4 and UCP5 share their functional properties (Hoang et al. 2012).

There is strong evidence that the regulated uncoupling caused by these proteins attenuates mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, protects against cellular damage, and (in beta-cells) diminishes insulin secretion. There are also untested suggestions that their transport of fatty acids may be physiologically important (Brand & Esteves 2005,  Esteves & Brand 2005, Krauss et al. 2005). The modest depolarization brought about by UCP activation is thought to diminish superoxide generation without significantly compromising ATP production, creating a protective, negative-feedback system that complements enzymatic defences against reactive oxygen species. 

There is some evidence that this mechanism is important in the etiology of Parkninson's Disease. Deletion of Park7 (DJ-1) decreased the abundance of Ucp5 and Ucp4 mRNA and compromised mitochondrial uncoupling in response to oxidant stress (Guzman et al. 2010). This may explain the unusual accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations with age in SNc dopaminergic neurons (Bender et al. 2006). These mutations, which are attributable to accumulated superoxide exposure, diminish mitochondrial competence and promote phenotypic decline, proteostatic impairments and death (Nicholls 2008).

A number of models have been proposed for the molecular mechanism by which fatty acids lead to increased proton conductance by UCP1 in brown adipose tissue mitochondria, and presumably by the other UCPs as well. These are the "fatty acid cycling" model and the "proton buffering" model. ''',
    167825: '''The "fatty acid cycling" hypothesis proposes that protonated fatty acids flip-flop in the membrane and deliver a proton to the matrix side.

    5627800: '''The PAKs (p21-activated kinases) are a family of serine/threonine kinases mainly implicated in cytoskeletal rearrangements. All PAKs share a conserved catalytic domain located at the carboxyl terminus and a highly conserved motif in the amino terminus known as p21-binding domain (PBD) or Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain. There are six mammalian PAKs that can be divided into two classes: class I (or conventional) PAKs (PAK1-3) and class II PAKs (PAK4-6). Conventional PAKs are important regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility and are additionally implicated in transcription through MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascades, death and survival signaling and cell cycle progression (Chan and Manser 2012).<p>PAK1, PAK2 and PAK3 are direct effectors of RAC1 and CDC42 GTPases. RAC1 and CDC42 bind to the CRIB domain. This binding induces a conformational change that disrupts inactive PAK homodimers and relieves autoinhibition of the catalytic carboxyl terminal domain (Manser et al. 1994, Manser et al. 1995, Zhang et al. 1998, Lei et al. 2000, Parrini et al. 2002; reviewed by Daniels and Bokoch 1999, Szczepanowska 2009). Autophosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in the catalytic domain of PAKs (T423 in PAK1, T402 in PAK2 and T436 in PAK3) is necessary for the kinase activity of PAK1, PAK2 and PAK3. Autophosphorylation of PAK1 serine residue S144, PAK2 serine residue S141, and PAK3 serine residue S154 disrupts association of PAKs with RAC1 or CDC42 and enhances kinase activity (Lei et al. 2000, Chong et al. 2001, Parrini et al. 2002, Jung and Traugh 2005, Wang et al. 2011).

    901023: '''Proteins that are released from the CNX or CRT complex with folding defects accumulate in a compartment of the ER called ERQC (Kamhi-Nesher et al. 2001). Here, the enzymes UGGG1 or UGGG2 are able to recognize glycoproteins with minor folding process and re-add the glucose on the alpha,1,3 branch; this is a signal for the transport of these glycoproteins back to the ER, where they can interact again with CNX or CRT in order to achieve a correct folding. At the same time that the glycoprotein is in the ERQC, the enzyme ER mannosidase I progressively removes the mannoses at positions 1A, 2A, B, C on N-glycans; when the mannose on 1A is trimmed, UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferases 1 and 2 (UGGT1 and 2) are no longer able to re-add the glucose, and therefore the protein is destined for ERAD. Glycoproteins subject to endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) undergo reglucosylation, deglucosylation, and mannose trimming to yield Man6GlcNAc2 and Man5GlcNAc2. These structures lack the mannose residue that is the acceptor of glucose transferred by UGGT1 and 2. For years it has been thought that the removal of the mannose in position B of the N-glycan was the signal to direct proteins to degradation. However, this mechanism has been described better by Avezov et al (Avezov et al. 2008) and it has been demonstrated that even glycoproteins with Man8 or Man7 glycans can be re-glucosylated and interact again with CNX or CRT (for a review on this topic, see Lederkremer 2009 and Maattanen P et al, 2010).''',

Like most Ras superfamily members, typical Rho proteins function as binary switches controlling a variety of biological processes. They perform this function by cycling between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound conformations. Mammalian Rho GTPases include RhoA, RhoB and RhoC (Rho proteins), Rac1 3 (Rac proteins), Cdc42, TC10, TCL, Wrch1, Chp/Wrch2, RhoD and RhoG, to name some. The family also includes RhoH and Rnd1-3, which lack GTPase activity and are predicted to exist in a constitutively active state.<p>Members of the Rho family have been identified in all eukaryotes. Including the atypical RHOBTB1-3 and RHOT1-2 proteins, 24 Rho family members have been identified in mammals (Jaffe and Hall, 2005; Bernards, 2005; Ridley, 2006). Among Rho GTPases, RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 have been most extensively studied. These proteins are best known for their ability to induce dynamic rearrangements of the plasma membrane-associated actin cytoskeleton (Aspenstrom et al, 2004; Murphy et al, 1999; Govek et al, 2005). Beyond this function, Rho GTPases also regulate actomyosin contractility and microtubule dynamics. Rho mediated effects on transcription and membrane trafficking are believed to be secondary to these functions. At the more macroscopic level, Rho GTPases have been implicated in many important cell biological processes, including cell growth control, cytokinesis, cell motility, cell cell and cell extracellular matrix adhesion, cell transformation and invasion, and development (Govek et al., 2005). The illustration below lists Rho GTPase effectors implicated in actin and microtubule dynamics (courtesy: Govek et al., 2005, Genes and Development, CSHL Press).''',
    8875940: '''Signaling by MET receptor is negatively regulated mainly by MET receptor dephosphorylation or MET receptor degradation. Protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPRJ dephosphorylates MET tyrosine residue Y1349, thus removing the docking site for the GAB1 adapter (Palka et al. 2003). Protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPN1 and PTPN2 dephosphorylate MET tyrosines Y1234 and Y1235 in the kinase activation loop, thus attenuating catalytic activity of MET (Sangwan et al. 2008). The E3 ubiquitin ligase CBL promotes ubiquitination of the activated MET receptor and subsequent MET degradation. CBL contains a RING finger domain that engages E2 protein ubiquitin ligases to mediate ubiquitination of MET, which may occur at the cell membrane or in the early endocytic compartment. Ubiquitinated MET is degraded in a late endosomal or lysosomal compartment in a proteasome-dependent manner. The involvement of proteasome in MET degradation seems to be indirect, through an effect on MET endocytic trafficking (Jeffers et al. 1997, Peschard et al. 2001, Hammond et al. 2001, Petrelli et al. 2002). LRIG1 promotes lysosome-dependent degradation of MET in the absence of HGF-mediated activation (Lee et al. 2014, Oh et al. 2014).<br>MET-mediated activation of RAS signaling is inhibited by MET receptor binding to MUC20 (Higuchi et al. 2004) or RANBP10 (Wang et al. 2004).''',

    8875945: '''Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), the ligand for MET receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), is secreted into the extracellular matrix (ECM) as an inactive single chain precursor (pro-HGF). The biologically active HGF is the heterodimer of alpha and beta chains that are produced via proteolytic cleavage of pro-HGF by the plasma membrane bound serine protease Hepsin (HPN) (Kirchhofer et al. 2005, Owen et al. 2010) or the ECM-associated serine protease Hepatocyte growth factor activator (HGFAC, commonly known as HGFA) (Shia et al. 2005). HGF binds to the extracellular SEMA and PSI domains of MET RTK, inducing a conformational change that enables MET dimerization or oligomerization (Kirchhofer et al. 2004, Stamos et al. 2004, Hays and Watowich 2004, Gherardi et al. 2006). MET dimers trans-autophosphorylate on tyrosine residues in the activation loop, leading to increased kinase activity, and on tyrosine residues at the cytoplasmic tail that serve as docking sites for adapter proteins involved in MET signal transduction (Ferracini et al. 1991, Longati et al. 1994, Rodrigues and Park 1994, Ponzetto et al. 1994).<br>CD44v6 was implicated as a MET co-receptor, but its role has been disputed (Orian-Rousseau et al. 2002, Dortet et al. 2010, Olaku et al. 2011, Hasenauer et al. 2013, Elliot et al. 2014).''',

MII activates the G protein transducin (Gt) that in turn activates phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6). Consequently, there is a fall in the intracellular concentration of cGMP that closes cGMP-dependent cation channels (CNG channels) and hyperpolarizes the rod.

The inactive precursor pro-IL1B has to be processed into mature bioactive form of IL1B and is usually mediated by inflammatory cysteine protease caspase-1. Gringhuis et al. showed that CLEC7A mediated processing of IL1B occurs through two distinct mechanisms: CLEC7A triggering induced a primary noncanonical caspase-8 inflammasome for pro-IL1B processing that was independent of caspase-1 activity, whereas some fungi triggered a second additional mechanism that required activation of the NLRP3/caspase 1 inflammasome. Unlike the canonical caspase-1 inflammasome, CLEC7A mediated noncanonical caspase-8-dependent inflammasome is independent of pathogen internalization.

PI5P inhibits AKT1 dephosphorylation by PP2A through an unknown mechanism (Ramel et al. 2009). Increased PI5P levels correlate with inhibitory phosphorylation(s) of the PP2A complex. MAPK1 (ERK2) and MAPK3 (ERK1) are involved in inhibitory phosphorylation of PP2A, in a process that involves IER3 (IEX-1) (Letourneux et al. 2006, Rocher et al. 2007).

    901038: '''After being synthesized in the ER membrane the 14-sugars lipid-linked oligosaccharide is co-translationally transferred to an unfolded protein, as described in the previous steps. After this point the N-glycan is progressively trimmed of the three glucoses and some of the mannoses before the protein is transported to the cis-Golgi. The role of these trimming reactions is that the N-glycan attached to an unfolded glycoprotein in the ER assume the role of 'tags' that direct the interactions of the glycoprotein with different elements that mediate its folding. The removal of the two outer glucoses leads to an N-glycan with only one glucose, which is a signal for the binding of either one of two chaperone proteins, calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT). These chaperones provide an environment where the protein can fold more easily. The interaction with these proteins is not transient and is terminated by the trimming of the last remaining glucose, after which the glycoprotein is released from  CNX or CRT and directed to the ER Quality Control compartment (ERQC) if it still has folding defects, or transported to the Golgi if the folding is correct. The involvement of N-glycans in the folding quality control of proteins in the ER explains why this form of glycosylation is so important, and why defects in the enzymes involved in these reactions are frequently associated with congenital diseases.  However, there are many unknown points in this process, as it is known that even proteins without N-glycosylation sites can be folded properly (Caramelo JJ and Parodi AJ, 2008).''',

Tat appears to be required in order to overcome the arrest of RNA Pol II by the negative transcriptional elongation factors DSIF and NELF (Wada et al. 1998; Yamaguchi et al. 1999; Yamaguchi et al 2002; Fujinaga et al. 2004). While Pol II can associate with the proviral LTR and initiate transcription in the absence of Tat, these polymerase complexes are non-processive and dissociate from the template prematurely producing very short transcripts (Kao et al. 1987). Tat associates with the RNA element, TAR, which forms a stem loop structure in the leader RNA sequence (Dingwall et al. 1989). Tat also associates with the cellular kinase complex P-TEFb(Cyclin T1:Cdk9) and recruits it to the TAR stem loop structure (Herrmann, 1995) (Wei et al. 1998). This association between Tat, TAR and  P-TEFb(Cyclin T1:Cdk9) is believed to bring the catalytic subunit of this kinase complex (Cdk9) in close proximity to Pol II where it hyperphosphorylates the CTD of RNA Pol II (Zhou et al. 2000). The RD subunits of NELF and the SPT5 subunit of DSIF, which associate through RD with the bottom stem of TAR, are also phosphorylated by P-TEFb(Cyclin T1:Cdk9)  (Yamaguchi et al. 2002; Fujinaga et al. 2004; Ivanov et al. 2000). Phosphorylation of RD results in its dissociation from TAR. Thus, Tat appears to facilitate transcriptional elongation of the HIV-1 transcript by hyperphosphorylating the RNA Poll II CTD and by removing the negative transcription elongation factors from TAR.

CYP (to represent cytochrome P450 superfamily), followed by an arabic number for the family, a capital letter for the subfamily and finally a second arabic number to denote the isoenzyme. An example is CYP1A1 which is the first enzyme in subfamily A of cytochrome P450 family 1.</p><p>The majority of the enzymes are present in the CYP1-4 families. CYP1-3 are primarily concerned with xenobiotic biotransformation whereas the other CYPs deal primarily with endogenous compounds. The CYP section is structured by the typical substrate they act upon. Of the 57 human CYPs, 7 encode mitochondrial enzymes, all involved in sterol biosynthesis.

The second group involves human proteins modified either by a mutation or by an abnormal post-translational event that produces an aberrant protein with a novel function. Examples include somatic mutations of EGFR and FGFR (epidermal and fibroblast growth factor receptor) genes, which encode constitutively active receptors that signal even in the absence of their ligands, or the somatic mutation of IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) that leads to an enzyme active on 2-oxoglutarate rather than isocitrate, or the abnormal protein aggregations of amyloidosis which lead to diseases such as Alzheimer's.<p>Infectious diseases are represented in Reactome as microbial-human protein interactions and the consequent events. The existence of variant proteins and their association with disease-specific biological processes is represented by inclusion of the modified protein in a new or variant reaction, an extension to the 'normal' pathway. Diseases which result from proteins performing their normal functions but at abnormal rates can also be captured, though less directly. Many mutant alleles encode proteins that retain their normal functions but have abnormal stabilities or catalytic efficiencies, leading to normal reactions that proceed to abnormal extents.

    1433558: '''Stem cell factor (SCF) is a growth factor with membrane bound and soluble forms. It is expressed by fibroblasts and endothelial cells throughout the body, promoting proliferation, migration, survival and differentiation of hematopoetic progenitors, melanocytes and germ cells.(Linnekin 1999, Ronnstrand 2004, Lennartsson and Ronnstrand 2006). The receptor for SCF is KIT, a tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK) closely related to the receptors for platelet derived growth factor receptor, colony stimulating factor 1 (Linnekin 1999) and Flt3 (Rosnet et al. 1991).  Four isoforms of c-Kit have been identified in humans. Alternative splicing results in isoforms of KIT differing in the presence or absence of four residues (GNNK) in the extracellular region. This occurs due to the use of an alternate 5' splice donor site. These GNNK+ and GNNK- variants are co-expressed in most tissues; the GNNK- form predominates and was more strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated and more rapidly internalized (Ronnstrand 2004). There are also splice variants that arise from alternative usage of splice acceptor site resulting in the presence or absence of a serine residue (Crosier et al., 1993). Finally, there is an alternative shorter transcript of KIT expressed in postmeiotic germ cells in the testis  which encodes a truncated KIT consisting only of the second part of the kinase domain and thus lackig the extracellular and transmembrane domains as well as the first part of the kinase domain (Rossi et al. 1991). Binding  of SCF homodimers to KIT results in KIT homodimerization followed by activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. KIT stimulation activates a wide array of signalling pathways including MAPK, PI3K and JAK/STAT (Reber et al. 2006, Ronnstrand 2004). Defects of KIT in humans are associated with different genetic diseases and also in several types of cancers like mast cell leukaemia, germ cell tumours, certain subtypes of malignant melanoma and gastrointestinal tumours.''',
    561111: '''The Interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-5 and Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptors form a family of heterodimeric receptors that have specific alpha chains but share a common beta subunit, often referred to as the common beta (Bc). Both subunits contain extracellular conserved motifs typical of the cytokine receptor superfamily. The cytoplasmic domains have limited similarity with other cytokine receptors and lack detectable catalytic domains such as tyrosine kinase domains.<br><br> IL-3 is a 20-26 kDa product of CD4+ T cells that acts on the most immature marrow progenitors. IL-3 is capable of inducing the growth and differentiation of multi-potential hematopoietic stem cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, macrophages, lymphoid and erythroid cells. IL-3 has been used to support the proliferation of murine cell lines with properties of multi-potential progenitors, immature myeloid as well as T and pre-B lymphoid cells (Miyajima et al. 1992). IL-5 is a hematopoietic growth factor responsible for the maturation and differentiation of eosinophils. It was originally defined as a T-cell-derived cytokine that triggers activated B cells for terminal differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. It also promotes the generation of cytotoxic T-cells from thymocytes. IL-5 induces the expression of IL-2 receptors (Kouro & Takatsu 2009). GM-CSF is produced by cells (T-lymphocytes, tissue macrophages, endothelial cells, mast cells) found at sites of inflammatory responses. It stimulates the growth and development of progenitors of granulocytes and macrophages, and the production and maturation of dendritic cells. It stimulates myeloblast and monoblast differentiation, synergises with Epo in the proliferation of erythroid and megakaryocytic  progenitor cells, acts as an autocrine mediator of growth for some types of acute myeloid leukemia, is a strong chemoattractant for neutrophils and eosinophils. It enhances the activity of neutrophils and macrophages. Under steady-state conditions GM-CSF is not essential for the production of myeloid cells, but it is required for the proper development of alveolar macrophages, otherwise, pulmonary alvelolar proteinosis (PAP) develops. A growing body of evidence suggests that GM-CSF plays a key role in emergency hematopoiesis (predominantly myelopoiesis)  in response to infection, including the production of granulocytes and macrophages in the bone marrow and their maintenance, survival, and functional activation at sites of injury or insult  (Hercus et al. 2009).<br><br> All three receptors have alpha chains that bind their specific ligands with low affinity (de Groot et al. 1998). Bc then associates with the alpha chain forming a high affinity receptor (Geijsen et al. 2001), though the in vivo receptor is likely be a higher order multimer as recently demonstrated for the GM-CSF receptor (Hansen et al. 2008).<br><br> The receptor chains lack intrinsic kinase activity, instead they interact with and activate signaling kinases, notably Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2). These phosphorylate the common beta subunit, allowing recruitment of signaling molecules such as Shc, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks), and the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs). The cytoplasmic domain of Bc has two distinct functional domains: the membrane proximal region mediates the induction of proliferation-associated genes such as c-myc, pim-1 and oncostatin M. This region binds multiple signal-transducing proteins including JAK2 (Quelle et al. 1994), STATs, c-Src and PI3 kinase (Rao and Mufson, 1995). The membrane distal domain is required for cytokine-induced growth inhibition and is necessary for the viability of hematopoietic cells (Inhorn et al. 1995). This region interacts with signal-transducing proteins such as Shc (Inhorn et al. 1995) and SHP and mediates the transcriptional activation of c-fos, c-jun, c-Raf and p70S6K (Reddy et al. 2000).<br><br><br><br>Figure reproduced by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Leukemia, WL Blalock et al. 13:1109-1166, copyright 1999.

They require a single transition metal ion and are typically studied in vitro as Zn2+-containing enzymes, though in vivo HDAC8 exhibits increased activity when substituted with Fe2+ (Gantt et al. 2006). The structurally-related enzyme acetylpolyamine amidohydrolase (APAH) (Leipe & Landsman 1997) exhibits optimal activity with Mn2+, followed closely by Zn2+ (Sakurada et al. 1996).<br><br>HDACs are often part of multi-protein transcriptional complexes that are recruited to gene promoters, regulating transcription without direct DNA binding. With the exception of HDAC8, all class I members can be catalytic subunits of multiprotein complexes (Yang & Seto 2008). HDAC1 and HDAC2 interact to form the catalytic core of several multisubunit complexes including Sin3, nucleosome remodeling deacetylase (NuRD) and corepressor of REST (CoREST) complexes (Grozinger & Schreiber 2002). HDAC3 is part of the silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) complex or the homologous nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) (Li et al. 2000, Wen et al. 2000, Zhang et al. 2002, Yoon et al. 2003, Oberoi et al. 2011) which are involved in a wide range of processes including metabolism, inflammation, and circadian rhythms (Mottis et al. 2013). <br><br>Class IIa HDACs  (HDAC4, -5, -7, and -9) shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Yang & Seto 2008, Haberland et al. 2009). The nuclear export of class IIa HDACs requires phosphorylation stimulated by calcium or other stimuli. They appear to have been evolutionarily inactivated as enzymes, having acquired a histidine substitution of the tyrosine residue in the active site of the mammalian deacetylase domain (H976 in humans) (Lahm et al. 2007, Schuetz et al. 2008). Instead they function as transcriptional corepressors for the MEF2 family of transcription factors (Yang & Gregoire 2005) .<br><br>Histones are the primary substrate for most HDACs except HDAC6 which is predominantly cytoplasmic and acts on alpha-tublin (Hubbert et al. 2002, Zhang et al. 2003, Boyault et al. 2007). HDACs also deacetylate proteins such as p53, E2F1, RelA, YY1, TFIIE, BCL6 and TFIIF (Glozak et al. 2005).<br><br>Histone deacetylases are targeted by structurally diverse compounds known as HDAC inhibitors (HDIs) (Marks et al. 2000). These can induce cytodifferentiation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of transformed cells (Marks et al. 2000, Bolden et al. 2006). Some HDIs have significant antitumor activity (Marks and Breslow 2007, Ma et al. 2009) and at least two are approved anti-cancer drugs.<br><br>The coordinates of post-translational modifications represented and described here follow UniProt standard practice whereby coordinates refer to the translated protein before any further processing. Histone literature typically refers to coordinates of the protein after the initiating methionine has been removed. Therefore the coordinates of post-translated residues in the Reactome database and described here are frequently +1 when compared with the literature.''',

The p53-dependent responses inhibit CDKs through the up-regulation of genes encoding CKIs mediated by the p53 protein, whereas the p53-independent mechanisms inhibit CDKs through the inhibitory T14Y15 phosphorylation of Cdk2.  Failure of DNA damage checkpoints in G1 leads to mutagenic replication of damaged templates and other replication defects.''',
    6811633: '''Under conditions of cellular stress, nuclear levels of phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PI5P) increase and, through interaction with ING2, result in nuclear retention/accumulation of ING2. ING2 binds TP53 (p53) and recruits histone acetyltransferase EP300 (p300) to TP53, leading to TP53 acetylation. Increased nuclear PI5P levels positively regulate TP53 acetylation (Ciruela et al. 2000, Gozani et al. 2003, Jones et al. 2006, Zou et al. 2007, Bultsma et al. 2010).''',

    69621: '''A hallmark of the human cell cycle in normal somatic cells is its precision. This remarkable fidelity is achieved by a number of signal transduction pathways, known as checkpoints, which monitor cell cycle progression ensuring an interdependency of S-phase and mitosis, the integrity of the genome and the fidelity of chromosome segregation.<p>Checkpoints are layers of control that act to delay CDK activation when defects in the division program occur. As the CDKs functioning at different points in the cell cycle are regulated by different means, the various checkpoints differ in the biochemical mechanisms by which they elicit their effect. However, all checkpoints share a common hierarchy of a sensor, signal transducers, and effectors that interact with the CDKs.<p>The stability of the genome in somatic cells contrasts to the almost universal genomic instability of tumor cells. There are a number of documented genetic lesions in checkpoint genes, or in cell cycle genes themselves, which result either directly in cancer or in a predisposition to certain cancer types. Indeed, restraint over cell cycle progression and failure to monitor genome integrity are likely prerequisites for the molecular evolution required for the development of a tumor. Perhaps most notable amongst these is the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which is mutated in >50% of human tumors.  Thus, the importance of the checkpoint pathways to human biology is clear.''',
    3215350: '''Arginine methylation is a common post-translational modification; around 2% of arginine residues are methylated in rat liver nuclei (Boffa et al. 1977). Arginine can be methylated in 3 different ways: monomethylarginine (MMA); NG,NG-asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and NG,N'G-symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA). The formation of MMA, ADMA and SDMA in mammalian cells is carried out by members of a family of nine protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) (Bedford & Clarke 2009). <br><br>Type I, II and III PRMTs generate MMA on one of the two terminal  guanidino nitrogen atoms. Subsequent generation of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is catalysed by the type I enzymes PRMT1, PRMT2, PRMT3, co-activator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), PRMT6 and PRMT8. Production of symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) is catalysed by the type II enzymes PRMT5 and PRMT7. On certain substrates, PRMT7 also functions as a type III enzyme, generating MMA only. PRMT9 activity has not been characterized. No known enzyme is capable of both ADMA and SDMA modifications. Arginine methylation is regarded as highly stable; no arginine demethylases are known (Yang & Bedford 2013). <br><br>Most PRMTs methylate glycine- and arginine-rich (GAR) motifs in their substrates (Boffa et al. 1977). CARM1 methylates a proline-, glycine- and methionine-rich (PGM) motif (Cheng et al. 2007). PRMT5 can dimethylate arginine residues in GAR and PGM motifs (Cheng et al. 2007, Branscombe et al. 2001). <br><br>PRMTs are widely expressed and are constitutively active as purified recombinant proteins. However, PRMT activity can be regulated through PTMs, association with regulatory proteins, subcellular compartmentalization and factors that affect enzyme-substrate interactions. The target sites of PRMTs are influenced by the presence of other PTMs on their substrates. The best characterized examples of this are for histones. Histone H3 lysine-19 acetylation (H3K18ac) primes the histone tail for asymmetric dimethylation at arginine-18 (H3R17me2a) by CARM1 (An et al. 2003, Daujat et al. 2002, Yue et al. 2007). H3 lysine-10 acetylation (H3K9ac) blocks arginine-9 symmetric dimethylation (H3R8me2s) by PRMT5 (Pal et al. 2004). H4R3me2a catalyzed by PRMT1 favours subsequent acetylation of the histone H4 tail (Huang et al. 2005). At the same time histone H4 lysine-5 acetylation (H4K5ac) makes the H4R3 motif a better substrate for PRMT5 compared with PRMT1, thereby moving the balance from an activating ADMA mark to a suppressive SDMA mark at the H4R3 motif (Feng et al. 2011). Finally methylation of Histone H3 on arginine-3 (H3R2me2a) by PRMT6 blocks methylation of H3 lysine-5 by the MLL complex (H3K4me3), and vice versa, methylation of H3K4me3 prevents H3R2me2a methylation (Guccione et al. 2007, Kirmizis et al. 2007, Hyllus et al. 2007).

    5615609: '''Co-expression of both protein O-mannosyl-transferases 1 and 2 (POMT1 and POMT2; CAZy family GT39) is necessary for enzyme activity, that is mediating the transfer of mannosyl residues to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues of proteins such as alpha-dystroglycan (DAG1; MIM:128239). DAG1 is a cell surface protein that plays an important role in the assembly of the extracellular matrix in muscle, brain, and peripheral nerves by linking the basal lamina to cytoskeletal proteins. Defects in POMT1 (MIM:607423) results in defective glycosylation of DAG1 and can cause severe congenital muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathies ranging from a severe type A, MDDGA1 (brain and eye abnormalities; MIM:236670), through a less severe type B, MDDGB1 (congenital form with mental retardation; MIM:613155) to a milder type C, MDDGC1 (limb girdle form; MIM:609308) (Bertini et al. 2011, Wells 2013).''',
    5623798: '''K+/Cl- cotransport is implicated not only in regulatory volume decrease, but also in transepithelial salt absorption, renal K+ secretion, myocardial K+ loss during ischemia and regulation of neuronal Cl- concentration. Four genes (SLC12A4-7) encode the K+/Cl- cotransporters KCC1-4 respectively. Cotransport of K+ and Cl- is electroneutral with a 1:1 stoichiometry. These cotransporters function as homomultimers or heteromultimers with other K+/Cl- cotransporters. SLC12A6 encodes KCC3 which is highly expressed in heart, brain, spinal cord, kidney, muscle, pancreas and placenta. Defects in SLC12A6 are a cause of agenesis of the corpus callosum with peripheral neuropathy (ACCPN; MIM:218000), a autosomal recessive disease characterised by severe progressive sensorimotor neuropathy, mental retardation, dysmorphic features and variable degree of agenesis of the corpus callosum (Howard et al. 2002, Dupre et al. 2003, Salin-Cantegrel et al. 2011).''',
