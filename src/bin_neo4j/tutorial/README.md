# Reactome's Neo4j Tutorial
Run Reactome's [tutorial](https://reactome.org/dev/graph-database/extract-participating-molecules) of Neo4j queries from Python scripts.

## Tutorial: Report participating molecules
Build a query to retrieve the resource and identifier of each participating molecule of a given Pathway in six stages:

1. [How to retrieve objects like proteins, reactions, pathways, etc.](https://reactome.org/dev/graph-database/extract-participating-molecules#retrieving-objects)
2. [How to get the identifier of proteins or chemicals](https://reactome.org/dev/graph-database/extract-participating-molecules#identifiers-proteins-or-chemicals)
3. [How to deconstruct complexes or sets to get their participants](https://reactome.org/dev/graph-database/extract-participating-molecules#complexes-sets-participants)
4. [How to retrieve the subpathways for a given pathway](https://reactome.org/dev/graph-database/extract-participating-molecules#retrieving-pathways)
5. [How to retrieve the reactions of a pathway](https://reactome.org/dev/graph-database/extract-participating-molecules#retrieving-reactions)
6. [How to retrieve the participants of a reaction](https://reactome.org/dev/graph-database/extract-participating-molecules#joining-pieces)
