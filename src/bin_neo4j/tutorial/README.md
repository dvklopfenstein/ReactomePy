# Reactome's Neo4j Tutorial
Run Reactome's [tutorial](https://reactome.org/dev/graph-database/extract-participating-molecules) of Neo4j queries from a Python script.

## The participating molecules use case
Build a query to retrieve the resource and identifier of each participating molecule of a given Pathway in six stages:

1. How to retrieve objects like proteins, reactions, pathways, etc.
2. How to get the identifier of proteins or chemicals
3. How to deconstruct complexes or sets to get their participants
4. How to retrieve the subpathways for a given pathway
5. How to retrieve the reactions of a pathway
6. How to retrieve the participants of a reaction
